<h3>
The Torso – Still More Weight Maps</h3>
The mirrored polygons of this torso share the same surface properties as
their counterparts on the original left side of the body. Interestingly
enough, the mirrored points also share the same weight values as their
counterparts on the original left side of the body. While this is good
for central weight maps (such as “Hips,” “Torso,” “Waist,” and “Neck”),
it also means the weight maps intended for the left side of the body unintentionally
cover the right side of the body as well.
<p>You need to divide those symmetrical weight maps prefixed with the word
“Left” into true Left and Right weight maps, using <b>Map > General > Copy
Map</b>, Volume Selection Mode, and <b>Map > General > Clear Map</b>.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso09.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice Weight
Map editing, you may load <b>torso09.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM). Go to the
layer that contains the left half of the torso.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Set the Perspective View display type to Weight Shade.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: From the Modeler drop-down list, select <b>Windows >
Vertex Maps Open/Close</b>.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: You should see a small white triangle pointing to the
word “Weight.” Left-click on this triangle to reveal a drop-down list of
every weight map in this object. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=158 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b></td>

<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig002.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig002.GIF" ALT="Figure 2" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=140 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 2</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 5</b>: In this list, right-click on the text string that says
“Left Arm” and select “Copy Vertex Map” from the drop-down list that results.
It will suggest calling the new map “Left Arm 1” – rename this to “Right
Arm” and click on “OK.” You have just created a copy of the “Left Arm”
weight map, called “Right Arm.” (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Make “Right” copies of the rest of the “Left” maps, as
indicated below:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Left Clavicle</b> (name the copy “Right Clavicle")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Forearm</b> (name the copy “Right Forearm”)</li>

<li>
<b>Left Hand</b> (name the copy “Right Hand”)</li>

<li>
<b>Left Index Finger</b> (name the copy "Right Index Finger")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Leg</b> (name the copy “Right Leg")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Mid Finger</b> (name the copy “Right Mid Finger")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Pinky</b> (name the copy “Right Pinky")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Shin</b> (name the copy “Right Shin")</li>

<li>
<b>Left Thumb</b> (name the copy “Right Thumb")</li>
</ul>
When all the maps have been copied as “Right” counterparts, the VMaps window
should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=379 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Activate Volume Selection Mode (Ctrl-j). In the Back
View, hold down the left mouse button and drag a bounding box over the
right half of the model. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig004.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig004.GIF" ALT="Figure 4" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=103 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 4</b>
<p>Volume Selection Mode has two types of selecting: Exclude and Include.
Exclude is represented by a dotted line; Include is represented by a solid
line. Exclude does not consider partially selected polygons to be truly
selected; Include considers partially selected polygons to be just as selected
as those polygons entirely within the Volume selection boundary.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Ctrl-j toggles between Exclude and Include mode. Type
Ctrl-j until the blue line of the bounding box turns into a solid line.
(<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure 4</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: We don’t want the wrong polygons to get selected. Zoom
in on the hip area. In the Back View, left-click on the rightmost edge
of the bounding box and drag it until it lies safely on the left side of
the center seam of points. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>) Now you don’t have to worry about the left side of the
model being affected in any way by the following operations. Type a to
Autosize the Views again.
<p><a href="Fig005.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig005.GIF" ALT="Figure 5" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=93 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 5</b>
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Let’s clear out any values on the “Left” weight maps
that fall into this selected right half of the model. In the VMaps window,
left-click on “Left Arm” to make it the current map. Type _ (the “underscore”
symbol -- hold down the Shift key and tap the “minus sign” button to create
it) to activate the Clear Map command (found as a button in <b>Map > General
> Clear Map</b>). Because only the right half of this model is selected,
the left half will be untouched as the unwanted right half values disappear
from the map.
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: Leave the right half of the model selected. In the VMaps
window, left-click on “Left Clavicle” and type “_” (the “underscore” symbol)
to Clear Map. Again, because Modeler cannot, will not touch unselected
geometry, the left side of the map is left alone as the right half of the
map disappears.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: When nothing is selected in Modeler, Modeler considers
<i>everything</i>
to be "selected."</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Repeat this process on every map whose name begins with
“Left,” until all values on the right-hand side of the body disappear from
the “Left” maps. You can get into a rhythm with this -- left-click on the
name of the map to select it, type underscore, left-click on the name of
the map to select it, type underscore. Select, edit, select, edit.
<p><a href="Fig006.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig006.GIF" ALT="Figure 6" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 6</b>
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: In the Back View, left-click on the leftmost edge of
the Volume Selection bounding box, hold down the left mouse button and
drag to the right until it becomes the rightmost edge, bounding the the
figure’s left half. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b>) You may zoom in to move the bounding box edge near the
center to the right of the center, or you may type Ctrl-j to turn this
bounding box type to Exclude, to make sure that none of the partially-selected
polygons on the right side of the body will be affected. Your call.
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Repeat what you did to the “Left” maps for all of the
weight maps that start with the word “Right” – left-click on the name of
the map in the VMaps window to select it, and type underscore once to clear
out unwanted values on the selected left side of the model.
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Look over the maps in the Perspective view to make sure
that no map marked “Left” or “Right” has values on <i>both</i> sides of
the body. If so, select the offending half of the body and type the underscore
key to clear out the unwanted values.
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Save this object as <b>torso18.lwo</b>.
