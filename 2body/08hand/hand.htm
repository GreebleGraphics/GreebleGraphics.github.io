<h3>
The Torso -- Hand Construction</h3>

<p><br>This part of the tutorial will tell you how to build a hand. The
next part will tell you how to attach it.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso11.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice building
a hand, you may load <b>torso11.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Go to an empty layer. Zoom in on the region of the model
sheet that displays the left hand. Set the Perspective view window to "Wireframe
Shade."
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: More experienced modelers may skip to Step 8 after
creating a box that looks like the one in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
1</font></b> -- 3x1x3 segments, about the size of the palm of the hand.
<p>People unfamiliar with the interactive Box tool should follow Steps
3-7.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Type Shift-x to activate the Box tool. (<b>Create > Objects
> Box</b>). In the Back View, left-click on the top of the wrist, hold
down the left mouse button and drag down and to the right. When the bottom
of the box touches the bottom of the wrist and the rightmost edge of the
box touches the base of the fingers, let go of the left mouse button.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Notice the blue highlights on the edges of the
box. You can still adjust the dimensions of this box by left-clicking and
dragging any of these highlights. You can also adjust the placement of
this box by left-clicking and dragging on the blue crosshairs in the center
of the box.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>Right now this "box" is a two-dimensional plane. Let's add some depth
to it.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: In the Right View, left-click on the center of the box,
hold down the left mouse button and drag to the right. The box will now
have gained depth. Keep dragging the right side of the box until it touches
the black circle that defines the root of the arm on the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: In the Right View, Left-click on the center of the leftmost
side of the box, hold down the left mouse button and drag to the left until
it, too, touches the black circle that defines the root of the arm on the
model sheet.
<p>You now have a box that's about the right size for the volume of the
elf-girl's palm, but we'll be using Bevel to create her fingers and thumb.
Before you "set" this box, you must make one final adjustment: the number
of segments that define each side of this box.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: In the tradition of Elfquest, this elf-girl will have
three fingers. Move your mouse pointer over the Top View and leave it there.
On your keyboard, tap the "up" arrow key twice. You should have increased
the number of segments along the Z axis by 2, making for a total of three
segments.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Let's not forget to make "room" for the thumb. With your
mouse pointer still in the Top View, tap the "right" arrow key twice. The
number of segments along the X axis should now be three, and the box should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 1</font></b>.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Type Ctrl-t to activate the Drag tool. (Notice that as
soon as you activated another modeling tool, the box lost its interactive
highlights -- it is now "set" in Modeler). In the Top View, Drag the points
of the left corners of the box in slightly towards the center, to make
the end of the box look more "rounded." (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
2</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: In the Top View, select the three polygons that form
the rightmost side of this box. Type b to activate the Bevel tool (<b>Multiply
> Extend > Bevel</b>). We are only going to create the root of the fingers
right now. Left-click and drag slightly to the right to shift these selected
polygons slightly away from the palm of the hand. Then drag slightly down
to shrink these polygons slightly -- just enough to separate each from the
other two. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 3</font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=139 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p>Like the Box tool, the Bevel tool's effects are still "tweakable" at
this stage. They will not be set in stone until you:
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
deactivate Bevel</li>

<li>
select another tool, or</li>

<li>
select/reselect another editing mode (ie: Points/Polygons/Volume Selection
mode)</li>
</ol>
<b>STEP 10</b>: Type b again to deactivate the Bevel tool, and to leave
its effect in place.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: The closer these polygons are to the palm, the
tighter the spaces between the fingers will be when the faces of the hand
are converted into SubPatch surfaces. Remember that the closer that two
points lie together, the tighter the curve running through those two points
will be, whether you deal with splines or SubPatch surfaces.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: It can't hurt to start applying weight maps at this
stage. Set the Perspective View window's display type to "Weight Shade."
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Deselect everything. Of the three polygons that you
beveled in Step 227, select the lowest one in the Top View -- the root of
the index finger. From the drop-down list next to the W, T, and M buttons
in the lower right-hand corner of Modeler, select "(new)" to activate the
Create Weight Map tool. Give this weight map a name of "Left Index Finger"
with an Initial Value of 100.0%, and click on "OK." It should look like

<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Deselect everything. Select the middle of the three
polygons that you beveled in Step 227 -- the root of the middle finger.
Create a weight map called "Left Mid Finger" with an Initial Value of 100.0%
for the points of this selected polygon. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
5</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Deselect everything. Select the last of the three polygons

<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Let's grow some fingers. Select the three polygons that
you just weight-mapped in the previous three steps. Type b to activate
the Bevel tool. Use this tool to grow the rough shapes of fingers, as seen
in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 7</font></b>, by left-clicking on the
selected geometry and dragging to the right (and slightly downwards, to
taper the fingers in the Top view).
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Leave these polygons selected. Let's give these rough
"fingers" a bit of taper in the Back View. Type h to activate the Stretch
tool. In the Back View, left-click on the bottom of the polygons, hold
down the Ctrl key to restrict movement to one axis, and drag the mouse
pointer downwards until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 8</font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 25</b>: Let's see how this looks as a SubPatch cage. Deselect
everything and hit the Tab key. We've already created our weight maps,

<p><b>STEP 26</b>: Before we distort this cage further, we ought to surface
it while it's still easy to select surfaces. With everything deselected,
type q to bring up the Change Surface&nbsp; dialog box. In the Name box,
type "Kara Glove." Leave the "Set Initial Color" box checked, and check
the "Smoothing" checkbox. Double-click on the gray box to the right of

surface's Color yellow for now, (such as RGB 220 160 000), with Smoothing
turned on.
<p><b>STEP 29</b>: Time to distort this object into more of a hand shape.
First, the fingertips should have more of a "slant" at their bottoms. Deselect
everything. In the Back View, select the points at the bottom of the fingertips.
Move these points towards the palm until the finger tips have more of a
taper, as seen in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 20</font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 30</b>: Deselect everything and select the polygons that form
the middle finger. Use the Stretch tool at the base of this finger to lengthen
it, until the lines of its SubPatch surfaces touch the black lines of the
model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 21</font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 31</b>: Deselect everything and then select the polygons that
form the pinky. Use the Stretch tool at its base to shorten it slightly,
until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 22</font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig022.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig022.GIF" ALT="Figure 22" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=160 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 22</b>
<p>The index and pinky fingers ought to have room to "spread out" when
rotated by their bones. Right now, however, their weight maps currently
have no control over any of the points of the palm. When the fingers spread
out right now, there's a risk of "crimping" happening at the outer edges
of the pinky and index fingers (since the palm points, unaffected by the
index and pinky bones, will remain fixed as the points of the index and
pinky rotate past them).
<p>We could give the weight maps of the pinky and index fingers co-ownership
of these points, but that might cause problems, too, as the outer points
might then rotate into the palm as the fingers spread out. (They wouldn't
rotate as much as the finger points, since the palm bones, having co-ownership,
would fight to keep them fixed...but they would probably still rotate inwards,
slightly).
<p>Let's see how far we can get by just moving the four closest palm points
out of the way. Instead of giving the index and pinky fingers co-ownership
of the palm points, we'll just give the index and pinky what they truly
need -- some "breathing room."
<p><b>STEP 32</b>: Deselect everything. Select the points shown in the
first panel of <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 23</font></b>, and Move
them towards the wrist. Pay attention to the SubPatch lines connecting
these points to the inner spaces between the fingers. When these lines
form 30-degree angles in relation to the base of the index and pinky fingers,
stop moving the points. (30 degrees will probably be the farthest the index
and pinky fingers will spread out). (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 23</font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 33</b>: Now to refine the thumb. Deselect everything. In the
Top View, select the points shown in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 24</font></b>
and Move them inwards, to give the thumb more of a taper.
<p>This thumb ought to hang down at a 30-degree angle, but Rotating it
to that angle in the Top, Back, or Right Views would be difficult. Happily,
we can use Modeler's tools in the Perspective View.
<p><b>STEP 34</b>: Select the polygons of the thumb. Rotate the Perspective
View until the selected edges of the sides the thumb line up with each
other. When they do, chances are good that the sides of the root of the
thumb are now perpendicular to you. Type y to activate the Rotate tool,
place the mouse pointer over the root of the thumb (the spot where the
base thumb bone would be), and Rotate the selected polygons until the tip
of the thumb touches the black lines defining the bottom of the thumb in
the Back View. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 25</font></b>)
