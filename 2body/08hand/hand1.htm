<h3>
The Torso – Hand Construction (Pt. 1)</h3>
First, we will build a hand. Then we will attach it to the arm.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso11.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice building
a hand, you may load <b>torso11.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Go to an empty layer. Zoom in on the region of the model
sheet that displays the left hand. Set the Perspective view window to “Wireframe
Shade.”
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: More experienced modelers may skip to Step 8 after
creating a box that looks like the one in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b> – 3x1x3 segments, about the size of the palm of the hand.
<p>People unfamiliar with the interactive Box tool should follow Steps
3-7.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Type Shift-x to activate the Box tool. (<b>Create > Objects
> Box</b>). In the Back View, left-click on the top of the wrist, hold
down the left mouse button and drag down and to the right. When the bottom
of the box touches the bottom of the wrist and the rightmost edge of the
box touches the base of the fingers, let go of the left mouse button.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Notice the blue highlights on the edges of the
box. You can still adjust the dimensions of this box by left-clicking and
dragging any of these highlights. You can also adjust the placement of
this box by left-clicking and dragging on the blue crosshairs in the center
of the box.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>Right now this “box” is a two-dimensional plane. Let’s add some depth
to it.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: In the Right View, left-click on the center of the box,
hold down the left mouse button and drag to the right. The box will now
have gained depth. Keep dragging the right side of the box until it touches
the black circle that defines the root of the arm on the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: In the Right View, Left-click on the center of the leftmost
side of the box, hold down the left mouse button and drag to the left until
it, too, touches the black circle that defines the root of the arm on the
model sheet.
<p>You now have a box that’s about the right size for the volume of the
elf-girl’s palm, but we’ll be using Bevel to create her fingers and thumb.
Before you “set” this box, you must make one final adjustment: the number
of segments that define each side of this box.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: In the tradition of Elfquest, this elf-girl will have
three fingers. Move your mouse pointer over the Top View and leave it there.
On your keyboard, tap the “up” arrow key twice. You should have increased
the number of segments along the Z axis by 2, making for a total of three
segments.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Let’s not forget to make “room” for the thumb. With your
mouse pointer still in the Top View, tap the “right” arrow key twice. The
number of segments along the X axis should now be three, and the box should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 1</font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Type Ctrl-t to activate the Drag tool. (Notice that as
soon as you activated another modeling tool, the box lost its interactive
highlights – it is now “set” in Modeler). In the Top View, Drag the points
of the left corners of the box in slightly towards the center, to make
the end of the box look more “rounded.” (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: In the Top View, select the three polygons that form
the rightmost side of this box. Type b to activate the Bevel tool (<b>Multiply
> Extend > Bevel</b>). We are only going to create the root of the fingers
right now. Left-click and drag slightly to the right to shift these selected
polygons slightly away from the palm of the hand. Then drag slightly down
to shrink these polygons slightly – just enough to separate each from the
other two. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=139 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p>Like the Box tool, the Bevel tool’s effects are still “tweakable” at
this stage. They will not be set in stone until you:
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
deactivate Bevel</li>

<li>
select another tool, or</li>

<li>
select/reselect another editing mode (ie: Points/Polygons/Volume Selection
mode)</li>
</ol>
<b>STEP 10</b>: Type b again to deactivate the Bevel tool, and to leave
its effect in place.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: The closer these polygons are to the palm, the
tighter the spaces between the fingers will be when the faces of the hand
are converted into SubPatch surfaces. Remember that the closer that two
points lie together, the tighter the curve running through those two points
will be, whether you deal with splines or SubPatch surfaces.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: It can’t hurt to start applying weight maps at this
stage. Set the Perspective View window’s display type to “Weight Shade.”
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Deselect everything. Of the three polygons that you
beveled in Step 9, select the lowest one in the Top View – the root of
the index finger. From the drop-down list next to the W, T, and M buttons
in the lower right-hand corner of Modeler, select “(new)” to activate the
Create Weight Map tool. Give this weight map a name of “Left Index Finger”
with an Initial Value of 100.0%, and click on “OK.” It should look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Deselect everything. Select the middle of the three
polygons that you beveled in Step 9 – the root of the middle finger. Create
a weight map called “Left Mid Finger” with an Initial Value of 100.0% for
the points of this selected polygon. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Deselect everything. Select the last of the three polygons
that you had beveled in Step 9 – the root of the pinky finger. Create a
weight map called “Left Pinky” with an Initial Value of 100.0% for the
points of the selected polygon. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Let’s grow some fingers. Select the three polygons that
you just weight-mapped in the previous three steps. Type b to activate
the Bevel tool. Use this tool to grow the rough shapes of fingers, as seen
in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure 7</a></font></b>,
by left-clicking on the selected geometry and dragging to the right (and
slightly downwards, to taper the fingers in the Top view).
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Leave these polygons selected. Let’s give these rough
“fingers” a bit of taper in the Back View. Type h to activate the Stretch
tool. In the Back View, left-click on the bottom of the polygons, hold
down the Ctrl key to restrict movement to one axis, and drag the mouse
pointer downwards until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure
8</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 17</b>: Deselect everything. Type Shift-k to activate the Knife
tool. In the Back View, make two cuts in the fingers – one cut for each
finger joint. It should look like the first panel of <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 18</b>: Deselect everything. In the Back View, select the points
that form the bottom of the roots of the fingers. Type t to activate the
Move tool, and move them up until they touch the black line that defines
the top of the thumb in the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 19</b>: These fingers need more geometry if they are going to
have a chance of maintaining their volume when bending. Deselect everything.
In the Back View, use the Knife tool to make two cuts on each side of the
“lines” that define the joints. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure
10</a></font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 20</b>: We’re going to grow the thumb next, but we should first
refine the shape of the palm for it. In the Top View, select the polygon
that will become the root of the thumb. Type y to activate the Rotate tool.
In the Top View, move the mouse pointer over the rightmost edge of the
polygon, left-click and drag to the left until the polygon lies at a 45-degree
angle. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig011.gif">Figure 11</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 21</b>: Leave this polygon selected. Use the Bevel tool to grow
a rough thumb, as seen in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig012.gif">Figure
