<h3>
The Torso -- Spline Cage (Pt. 3)</h3>
The area bounded by the neck, shoulder, innermost arm spline circle, and
breast-level spline ellipse poses a problem. This area is currently defined
by six splines (six "sides"), instead of three or four.
<p>Just as subdivision surfaces won't accept anything other than three-
and four-sided polygons, LightWave's Spline Patch operation won't accept
anything other than three- and four-sided spline boundaries/patches. We
must therefore add splines that break up this six-sided boundary into three-
or four-sided boundaries.
<p>

<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: We can find some helpful examples in grade-school
geometry, as seen in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig026.gif">Figure
26</a></font></b>. When breaking up the following forms into the maximum
number of quadrangles (four-sided shapes) and the fewest triangles:
<p>Pentagon = quadrangle + triangle
<br>Hexagon = two quadrangles
<br>Heptagon = two quadrangles + triangle
<br>Octagon = three quadrangles

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 33</b>: In the Top view, select the "lowest" point of the neck
circle and the "lowest" point of the innermost arm circle (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig027.gif">Figure
27</a></font></b>). Type Ctrl-p to create a spline. Then select the "topmost"
point of the neck circle and the the "topmost" point of the innermost arm
circle (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig028.gif">Figure 28</a></font></b>),
and type Ctrl-p to create a spline.

<p>Almost there, but some of the splines don't quite match the black lines
of the model sheet. We'll fix that in the next step.
<p><b>STEP 34</b>: In Points Selection Mode, deselect all points. Go to
Polygon Selection Mode. In the Back view, select the spline that joins
the lowest points of the arm circles. Activate the Add Points tool (if
you have not yet added a hotkey for this, you'll find it in <b>Polygon
> Revise > Add Points</b>). In the Back view, left-click on the center
of the spline. A new point should be added to the center of the spline.
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig029.gif">Figure
29</a></font></b> demonstrates this procedure.

<br><b>Figure 29</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: I strongly recommend using a hotkey for Add Points.
I personally prefer using the hotkey Ctrl-x for Add Points. That way, I
can hold my left pinky finger down on the Ctrl key and use my left index
finger to type x or t, quickly toggling between Add Points (Ctrl-x) and
the Drag tool (Ctrl-t).
<p><b>Warning</b>: Add Points works unpredictably on splines in LightWave
6.5a. If Add Points places the new point too close to another point, you
may not be able to Drag the new point without also dragging the other point.
If the new point lies too close to another point, type u (Undo) until the
new point disappears and try Add Points again -- this time clicking on a
<i>slightly</i> different area of the spline.
<p>This bug does not appear in LightWave 6.5b or LightWave 7. (LightWave
6.5a users, take heart -- both you and LightWave 6 users can download the
LightWave 6.5b upgrade for free from <a href="http://www.newtek.com/">NewTek's
site</a>).</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 35</b>: Select the spline that defines the left side of the
torso. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig030.gif">Figure 30</a></font></b>)
Right now it is made up of three points, giving it two sections. Add a
point to the middle of each section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool
to move each of these new points until the spline matches the shape of
the black line defining the torso's left side in the model sheet.

<p><b>STEP 36</b>: Select the spline that defines the top of the left shoulder.
(<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig031.gif">Figure 31</a></font></b>)
Add a point to the middle of each section using Add Points. Use the Drag
tool to move each new point until the spline follows the shape of the black
line defining the shoulder.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: In this tutorial, don't worry if the shoulder spline
does not perfectly match the drawing. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig031.gif">Figure
31</a></font></b>) Pay closer attention to the arcs that each of the splines
make in 3D space. The smoother and more rounded the arcs, the better the
model will look when finished. You can always tweak the spline cage after
it's finished.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 37</b>: Select the other two splines that connect the neck circle
to the arm circle. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig032.gif">Figure
32</a></font></b>) To leave both of them perfectly straight would mean
two odd "creases" in the model's shoulders, because you would have two
straight rows of points in the middle of curved rows of points. These two
splines need to "go with the flow." Add a point to the center of each spline
using Add Points. In the Back View, use the Drag tool to drag the new points
downwards, until the curve of these splines complements the downward curve
of the shoulder spline.

<br><b>Figure 32</b>
<p><b>STEP 38</b>: Now it looks good from the Back View, but the Right
View suggests that the chest and back of the model will start to cave in
towards the middle of these splines. In the Right View, Drag the new point
of the front spline slightly towards the negative Z axis. Stop when it
appears to lie midway between the edge of the arm circle and the front
of the chest. Now to fix the back. Drag the new point of the back splines
slightly towards the positive Z axis. Stop after it can be seen outside
of the arm circle. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig032.gif">Figure
32</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 39</b>: In the Right View, select the spline that defines the
front of the chest. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig033.gif">Figure
33</a></font></b>) Add a point to its lowest section using Add Points.
Use the Drag tool to move this new point until the spline matches the black
line of the model sheet.

<p><b>STEP 40</b>: In the Right View, select the spline that defines the
spine. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig034.gif">Figure 34</a></font></b>).
Add a point to its lowest section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool to
move this new pont until the spline follows the black line of the model
sheet.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: Because this tutorial will later have you patching
this spline cage with 2-by-2 patches, having more than one "tweak point"
per section of spline will not matter.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 41</b>: Now for the neck. She could use a longer neck. Deselect
all splines, then select the four splines that form the neck circle. Type
c to Copy this geometry. Just so that it won't accidentally get pasted
on top of the original, go to an empty layer. Then type v to Paste a copy
of the neck circle. Type t to bring up the Move tool. In the Right View,
move the copy of the neck circle up and to the left until it lies inside
the top of the model's neck. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig035.gif">Figure
35</a></font></b>) Then type x to Cut the geometry out of this layer. Go
to the original layer, and type v to Paste it.

<p><b>STEP 42</b>: Now to connect this neck to the rest of the cage with
splines. Enter Points Selection Mode. In the Right View select the "leftmost"
point of each neck circle, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig036.gif">Figure
36</a></font></b>) Then select the "rightmost" point of each neck circle,
and type Ctrl-p to create a spline. Finally, in the Back View, select the
"rightmost" points of each neck circle, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 43</b>: That's it. You're done with the upper torso! Save this
object as <b>torso03.lwo</b> (using "Save Object As" in the File menu,
of course). ...now you just need to build the hip section.
