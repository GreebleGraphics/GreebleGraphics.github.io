<h3>
The Torso -- Spline Cage</h3>

<p><br>Before we start, I'd like to give you a bit of a roadmap for the
torso spline cage. <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 2</font></b> shows front,
side, and three-quarter views of the complete torso spline cage. <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
3</font></b> focuses on the upper portion without its neck, and <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
4</font></b> focuses on the hip splines.

<br><b>Figure 4</b>
<p>For your reference, this spline cage is included on the CD-ROM as <b>s-torso.lwo</b>.
You may also copy its geometry into a background layer for guidance during
this part of the tutorial, if you wish.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Open Modeler. Make sure that the lower-left viewport
is set to the Back (XY) view and that the lower-right viewport is set to
the Right (ZY) view. Also make sure that the upper-left viewport is set
to the Top (XZ) view and that the upper-right viewport is set to the Perspective
view.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Type d to summon the Display Options panel. Left-click
on its Backdrop tab. In the Backdrop section, left-click on the Presets
drop-down menu, and select "Load Backdrop." Load the <b>kara.cfg</b> file
that you had saved when you set up Modeler's backdrops in the last section.
<p>You should now have images of the elf girl in the backdrop, ready to
trace.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Zoom in on the neck and torso area.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><b>Longer Version</b>: LightWave gives you several options for zooming
in on a detail. I sometimes prefer using the hotkeys alone, since it's
quick and I don't have to deactivate the tool I'm currently using or fuss
with a titlebar button.
<p>Try this: in the lower-right viewport, move the mouse pointer over the
center of the elf's torso, and tap g on the keyboard. This will center
the views around the torso area. (By doing this in the Right view, the
Y axis remains perfectly centered in the Back view). Now tap on the > key
(technically, you should tap on the period key WITHOUT holding down the
Shift key, but it's easier to remember this key as the "greater than" sign).
<p>If you want to pan around your view, move your mouse pointer to the
Right view and hold down the left mouse button and the Alt key. As long
as you hold down the Alt key, you'll be able to pan around the view by
dragging the mouse pointer. (If you're in a Perspective view, you'll have
to hold down the Alt key as well as the Shift key to pan around the view).</td>

</table>

<p><b>STEP 4</b>: For this model, make the neck, waist, and root of the
arm as rounded as possible. With splines, you need about eight points for
a perfect circle. The easiest way to create these points to use the Disc
tool. Left-click on the button for the Disc tool (<b>Objects > Primitives
> Disc</b>). Type n to activate its Numeric panel. Left-click on its Actions
drop-down menu and select Activate. Use the settings listed below (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
5</font></b>). (As you type in the following values, use the Tab key to
enter each value and advance to the next input field):
<p>Axis: Y
<br>Sides: 8
<br>Segments: 1
<br>Bottom: 0m
<br>Top: 0m
<br>Center X: 0m
<br>Y: 0m
<br>Z: 0m
<br>Radius X: 40mm
<br>Y: 0m
<br>Z: 40mm
<p><a href="Fig005.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig005.GIF" ALT="Figure 5" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 5</b>
<p>Exit the Numeric Panel by left-clicking on the button with the x mark
on it in the uppermost-right-hand corner of the window. The disc will still
have a blue bounding box around it. Left-click on the Disc button again,
and the bounding box will disappear.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b>: The blue bounding box means that the disc it surrounds
is not yet "set." If you were to deselect everything by left-clicking on
the blank grey areas on the toolbars, the disc will disappear. If you were
to do anything else (from using another tool to entering/re-entering one
of the Selection Modes), the disc will get fixed in place and its bounding
box will disappear.</td>

adjust the placement and dimensions of the primitive geometry that you
are creating.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Type k to kill the octagon you have just created, leaving
its points behind.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Type Ctrl-g to enter Point Selection Mode. Move your
mouse pointer to the Top view.
<p>We are going to create four three-point splines that together form the
shape of a circle. Because<b> the order in which you select points matters</b>,
it is <i>essential</i> that you select these points in the order that you
want the "line" of the spline to be "drawn." In this case, you must select
the points in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion, so as to define
the border of a circle.
<p>Tip: Think of point selection as a 3D version of connect-the-dots. The
order in which you select the points is the order in which the "line" describing
the spline curve will be "drawn."
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: In the Top view, left-click on the "topmost" point to
select it. Holding down the left mouse button, select the two points to
its right in a clockwise fashion (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 6</font></b>
and <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 7</font></b>). Let go of the left mouse
button. Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.

<br><b>Figure 7</b>
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Select the rightmost point and the next two points underneath
it in a clockwise fashion (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 7</font></b>).
Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Select the bottom point and the two points to its left
in a clockwise fashion. Type Ctrl-p to create a spline (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
8</font></b>).
<p><a href="Fig008.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig008.GIF" ALT="Figure 8" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=44 width=200></a>

<td><b>Note</b>: Since the Top view has nothing to do with the Y axis (which
is what one might normally think of when referring to "up" and "down"),
"topmost" and "bottom" are used as relative terms here.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Select the leftmost point and the two points to its
right in a clockwise fashion. Type Ctrl-p to create a spline (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
8</font></b>). You should now have a spline boundary that looks like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
9</font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig009.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig009.GIF" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: From a distance you can't see it, but up close this
spline boundary looks slightly sharp at its "corners" (those points that
lie directly on the X and Z axes). Type Ctrl-h to enter Polygon Selection
Mode. The splines you have just created should automatically be selected
(in case they are not, select them now). Now type Ctrl-s to Smooth all
selected curves that share endpoints (<b>Detail > Curves > Smooth</b>).
Any trace of a corner on this spline boundary will now disappear (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
10</font></b>).

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b>: Each of the Smoothed splines are now made up of five points,
instead of three. If you don't believe me, select one and copy it to another
layer. When you paste it, you'll see a "three-point" spline and two seemingly
unattached points. When you select it, however, you'll see dotted lines
extending to the "unattached" points. These "unattached" points act as
control points of the ends of this spline, letting you tweak the curves
of the spline's ends. The dotted lines act as visual "handles."</td>

<td><b>Control Points</b>: You can toggle control points on and off by
using Ctrl-b and Ctrl-n.&nbsp; Notice that those parts of the curve that
run through the next-to-last points remain the same whether or not the
control points have been toggled on or not. The dotted lines of the handles
serve more than a cosmetic purpose, however. If you try to use a spline
for a Lathe, Rail Extrude, or Rail Clone, those operations will only care
about the non-handle portion of the spline. Toggling spline handles on
and off does makes a difference.</td>

though, Ctrl-s will do all the work for you.</td>

</table>

<p>You now have a spline boundary that describes a circle. We'll use copies
of this spline boundary for the elf's neck, waist, and arms.
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Type t to activate the Move tool (<b>Modify > Move >
Move</b>). In the Right view, drag the spline boundary up until it reaches
the base of the neck. (We'll fine-tune this later).
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Select all geometry. Type c to copy this geometry. Type
t to activate the Move tool. In the Right view, drag the spline circle
down until it reaches the underside of the belt. Type v to paste the copied
geometry. You should now have two spline circles -- one at the waist, and
one at the neck.
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Deselect everything. Select the spline circle at the
neck. In the Back view, move the mouse pointer to the leftmost corner of
the neck circle. Type r to Rotate this geometry 90 degrees to the right.
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Type t to activate the Move tool. In the Back view,
move this geometry to the end of the shoulder. In the Right view, move
it slightly to the left until it fits inside the black circle of the model
sheet.
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Type v to re-paste the neck circle you had copied in
Step 29. You should now have three spline circles -- one for the neck, one
for the waist, and one for the root of the arm. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
11</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 17</b>: Deselect everything. Select the waist spline circle.
Type h to bring up the Stretch tool. In the Right view, move your mouse
pointer to the center of the waist spline circle. Left-click and drag to
the right until the edges of the waist spline circle touch the black torso
lines of the model sheet.
<p>Chances are that the rightmost edge will reach the black lines first.
If that happens, just let go of the left mouse button, left-click on the
rightmost edge and continue to drag to the right until the leftmost edge
touches the black line.
<p><b>STEP 18</b>: In the Back view, left-click on the center of the waist
spline and drag to the right until the edges of the waist spline circle
touch the black lines of the model sheet. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
12</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 19</b>: Even at this early stage, it's a good idea to save what
you have done so far. In the Objects folder of your Content directory,
create a new folder named <b>Kara</b>. Save this object in that folder
as <b>torso01.lwo</b>. Then save it again ("Save Object As") as <b>torso02.lwo</b>.
<p>As we go through the next set of steps, feel free to tap the s key periodically
to save the changes you make to "<b>torso02.lwo</b>." (<b>torso01.lwo</b>
will always contain the work you did up to Step 35).
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >

<td><b>Note</b>: Always save your model in stages, so that you have the
option of accessing an older version of your model.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 20</b>: Deselect everything. Select the waist splines. Type
c to Copy them. Type v to Paste them (the original's still selected, so
it's safe to do this). Type t to activate the Move tool. In the Right view,
move these splines up until they sit just above the "corner" in the contour
of the back (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 13</font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 21</b>: With these splines still selected, and the Move tool
still active, type c to Copy and v to Paste. Hold down the Ctrl key to
help restrict the current tool (in this case, the Move tool) to one axis.
In the Back view, move the selected splines up until they are level with
the tops of the red lines that define the breasts (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
14</font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 22</b>: Type h to bring up the Stretch tool (<b>Modify > Stretch
> Stretch</b>). In both the Back and Right views, Stretch the selected
splines until their edges touch the black lines of the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 23</b>: Deselect everything. Select the spline boundary immediately
below and Stretch it until its edges touch the black lines of the model
sheet. You should now have something that looks like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
15</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 24</b>: Deselect everything. Select the splines of the arm circle.
Type c and v to Copy and Paste it. Type t to activate the Move tool. In
the Back view, move the still-selected original right above the edge of
the widest spline ellipse. Type h to bring up the Stretch tool. In the
Back view, Stretch the selected spline boundary until its top edge touches
the black shoulder line of the model sheet and its bottom edge touches
the widest of the spline ellipses (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 16</font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 25</b>: These two spline ellipses almost join at the armpit.
Let's join them now. Deselect everything. Go into Point Selection Mode.
In the Right view, select the lowest point of the innermost arm ellipse.
In the Back view, select the "rightmost" point of the widest spline ellipse.
Type Ctrl-w to Weld these two points into a single point (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
17</font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 26</b>: Time to work on the profile. In the Right view, in order
from neck to waist, select the four points that lie on the black line that
defines the front of the character (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 18</font></b>).
Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 27</b>: In the Right view, in order from neck to waist, select
the four points that lie on the black line that defines the back of the
character (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 19</font></b>). Type Ctrl-p
to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 28</b>: In the Back view, in order from armpit to waist, select
the three points that lie on the black line that defines the character's
left side. (Since you face the character, that actually means the line
that defines the character's side on your right, as shown in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
20</font></b>). Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p>The neck circle is currently lying at the wrong angle. Originally we
wanted it horizontal, so that we could make perfect horizontal and vertical
copies of it for the waist and arm. Now, however, we need to rotate it
so that it fits the contour of a real neck (higher in the back, lower in
the front).
<p><b>STEP 29</b>: Deselect everything. Select the circle of splines that
defines the root of the neck. Type y to bring up the Rotate tool (<b>Modify
> Rotate > Rotate</b>). In the Right view, move the cursor over the center
point of the neck spline circle. Left-click on this point and drag to the
right. On the black lines of the model sheet, note the "corner" where the
neck joins the torso. Stop rotating the neck spline circle when its leftmost
edge touches this corner. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
21</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 30</b>: In Points Selection Mode, select the rightmost point
of the neck spline circle in the Back view. Then (in order from left to
right) select the topmost points of the arm spline circles (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
22</font></b>). Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 31</b>: While still in the Back view, select the lowest points
on the two arm spline circles, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
23</font></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >

<td><b>Note</b>: Again, whenever you create a two-point spline for a spline
cage, selection order does not matter. You can even right-click on the
mouse and Lasso these two points, if you want.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 32</b>: In the Top view, select the "lowest" two points of the
arm circles (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 24</font></b>), and type Ctrl-p
to create a spline. Then select the "topmost" two points of the arm circles
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 25</font></b>), and type Ctrl-p to create
a spline.
<p>The area bounded by the neck, shoulder, innermost arm spline circle,
and breast-level spline ellipse poses a problem. This area is currently
defined by six splines (six "sides"), instead of three or four.
<p>Just as subdivision surfaces won't accept anything other than three-
and four-sided polygons, LightWave's Spline Patch operation won't accept
anything other than three- and four-sided spline boundaries/patches. We
must therefore add splines that break up this six-sided boundary into three-
or four-sided boundaries.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td><b>Tip</b>: We can find some helpful examples in grade-school geometry,
as seen in <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 26</font></b>. When breaking
up the following forms into the maximum number of quadrangles (four-sided
shapes) and the fewest triangles:
<p>Pentagon = quadrangle + triangle
<br>Hexagon = two quadrangles
<br>Heptagon = two quadrangles + triangle
<br>Octagon = three quadrangles</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 33</b>: In the Top view, select the "lowest" point of the neck
circle and the "lowest" point of the innermost arm circle (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
27</font></b>). Type Ctrl-p to create a spline. Then select the "topmost"
point of the neck circle and the the "topmost" point of the innermost arm
circle (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 28</font></b>), and type Ctrl-p
to create a spline.
<p>Almost there, but some of the splines don't quite match the black lines
of the model sheet. We'll fix that in the next step.
<p><b>STEP 34</b>: In Points Selection Mode, deselect all points. Go to
Polygon Selection Mode. In the Back view, select the spline that joins
the lowest points of the arm circles. Activate the Add Points tool (if
you have not yet added a hotkey for this, you'll find it in <b>Polygon
> Revise > Add Points</b>). In the Back view, left-click on the center
of the spline. A new point should be added to the center of the spline.
Figure <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 29</font></b> demonstrates this
procedure.

<td><b>Tip</b>: I strongly recommend using a hotkey for Add Points. I personally
prefer using the hotkey Ctrl-x for Add Points. That way, I can keep my
left pinky held down on the Ctrl key and use my left index finger to type

type u (Undo) until the new point disappears and try Add Points again --
this time clicking on a <i>slightly</i> different area of the spline.</td>

</table>

<p><b>STEP 35</b>: Select the spline that defines the left side of the
torso. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 30</font></b>) Right now it is
made up of three points, giving it two sections. Add a point to the middle
of each section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool to move each of these
new points until the spline matches the shape of the black line defining
the torso's left side in the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 36</b>: Select the spline that defines the top of the left shoulder.
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 31</font></b>) Add a point to the middle
of each section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool to move each new point
until the spline follows the shape of the black line defining the shoulder.

<td><b>Tip</b>: In this tutorial, don't worry if the spline does not perfectly
match the drawing. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 31</font></b>) Pay
attention first to the arcs the splines make in 3D space. The smoother
and more rounded the arcs, the better the model will look when finished.
You can always tweak the spline cage after it's finished.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 37</b>: Select the other two splines that connect the neck circle
to the arm circle. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 32</font></b>) To leave
both of them perfectly straight would mean two odd "creases" in the model's
shoulders, because you would have two straight rows of points in the middle
of curved rows of points. These two splines need to "go with the flow."
Add a point to the center of each spline using Add Points. In the Back
View, use the Drag tool to drag the new points downwards, until the curve
of these splines complements the downward curve of the shoulder spline.
<p><b>STEP 38</b>: Now it looks good from the Back View, but the Right
View suggests that the chest and back of the model will start to cave in
towards the middle of these splines. In the Right View, Drag the new point
of the front spline slightly towards the negative Z axis. Stop when it
appears to lie midway between the edge of the arm circle and the front
of the chest. Now to fix the back. Drag the new point of the back splines
slightly towards the positive Z axis. Stop after it can be seen outside
of the arm circle. It should look like Figure <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
32</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 39</b>: In the Right View, select the spline that defines the
front of the chest. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 33</font></b>) Add
a point to its lowest section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool to move
this new point until the spline matches the black line of the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 40</b>: In the Right View, select the spline that defines the
spine. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 34</font></b>). Add a point to
its lowest section using Add Points. Use the Drag tool to move this new
pont until the spline follows the black line of the model sheet.

<p><b>STEP 41</b>: Now for the neck. She could use a longer neck. Deselect
all splines, then select the four splines that form the neck circle. Type
c to Copy this geometry. Just so that it won't accidentally get pasted
on top of the original, go to an empty layer. Then type v to Paste a copy
of the neck circle. Type t to bring up the Move tool. In the Right View,
move the copy of the neck circle up and to the left until it lies inside
the top of the model's neck. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 35</font></b>)
Then type x to Cut the geometry out of this layer. Go to the original layer,
and type v to Paste it.
<p><b>STEP 42</b>: Now to connect this neck to the rest of the cage with
splines. Enter Points Selection Mode. In the Right View select the "leftmost"
point of each neck circle, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
36</font></b>) Then select the "rightmost" point of each neck circle, and
type Ctrl-p to create a spline. Finally, in the Back View, select the "rightmost"
points of each neck circle, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 43</b>: That's it. You're done with the upper torso! Save this
object as <b>torso03.lwo</b> (using "Save Object As" in the File menu,
of course). ...now you just need to build the hip section.
<p><b>STEP 44</b>: It'll be easier to work in a new empty layer, but you
should first gather some raw materials. The hip connects to the bottom
of this torso cage, so we'll need a copy of the spline ellipse that defines
the bottom of the torso cage. The outermost arm spline circle is a perfect
circle that still lies in an orthogonal plane (unlike the neck circles,
which have been Rotated, or the torso circles, which have been Stretched)
-- we can use copies of the arm circle to form the leg circles.
<p>Go into Polygon Selection Mode. Deselect all splines. Move the mouse
pointer near the outermost arm circle, and hold down the right mouse button
so that you can use the Lasso. Lasso the outermost arm circle to select
it, letting go of the right mouse button when you're done. Hold down the
Shift key so that you can select additional geometry. Select the four splines
that define the bottom of the torso cage. Type c to Copy this geometry.
Go into a new empty layer and type v to Paste the copied geometry into
the new layer. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 37</font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 45</b>: Zoom out a bit so that you can see the legs of the model
sheet. Select the arm spline circle. Type Shift-t to bring up the Move
tool, and Move the circle underneath the waist spline ellipse until the
edge of the arm circle touches the corner of the model sheet's crotch.
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 38</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 46</b>: Zoom in to the hip area. Select the arm circle (if it's
not selected already). In the Back View, move your mouse pointer over the
lowest point of the arm circle, and type r to Rotate the arm circle a perfect
90 degrees to the right.
<p><b>STEP 47</b>: Type Shift-h to bring up the Size tool (<b>Modify >
Stretch > Size</b>). In the Back View, place the mouse pointer over the
"leftmost" point of the arm circle (which will from now on be referred
to as the "leg" circle). Left-click and drag to the right until the right
edge of the leg circle touches the outermost black line of the model sheet.
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 39</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 48</b>: Type Shift-t to bring up the Move tool. Go to the Right
View. Hold down the Ctrl key to restrict movement to one axis, and Move
the selected leg circle to the left until it lies between the black lines
of the model sheet that define the leg. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
40</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 49</b>: Go to Points Selection Mode. In the Back View, select
the "leftmost" point of the leg circle. Type c to Copy this point, and
v to Paste it. The copy is lying right on top of the original point...but
you have the original selected, not the copy. No problem. Deselect everything,
type w to bring up Point Statistics (<b>Modeler > Windows > Statistics
Open/Close</b>). Click on the "plus" sign next to the text string that
says "0 Polygons." All points in this layer that are not connected to any
polygons at all will be selected. In this case, it'll just be the one point
that you copied and pasted. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 41</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 50</b>: With this point selected, type Ctrl-v to bring up the
Set Value tool (<b>Detail > Points > Set Value</b>). Set it to 0m on the
X axis and click on OK. The point will snap to the X axis. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
42</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 51</b>: Leave this point selected. In the Back View, hold down
the Shift key and select the "leftmost" point of the leg circle again.
Type Ctrl-p to create a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 43</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 52</b>: In the Back View, select the "rightmost" points of both
the waist and leg spline boundaries, and type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 44</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 53</b>: In the Back View, select the point that defines the
center of the crotch. Then, holding down the Shift key in the Right View,
select the "leftmost" point of the waist spline ellipse. Type Ctrl-p to
create a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 45</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 54</b>: Return to the Back View. Again, select the point that
defines the center of the crotch. Then, holding down the Shift key in the
Right View, select the "rightmost" point of the waist spline ellipse. Type
Ctrl-p to create a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 46</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 55</b>: Now we'll get these three splines to better match the
lines drawn on the model sheet. Enter Polygon Selection Mode. In the Right
View, select the "leftmost" of the three new splines. Add three points
to it with the Add Points tool, and use the Drag tool to drag these three
new points until it matches the black line defining the front of the hip
section. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 47</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 56</b>: In the Back View, select the spline closest to the outside
of the hip. Add one point to it with the Add Points tool, and use the Drag
tool to drag the new point out until the spline follows the black line
defining the outside of the hip. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 48</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 57</b>: In the Right View, select the "rightmost" of the three
new splines. Add three points to it with the Add Points tool. Use the Drag
tool to drag these new points until the top part of the spline matches
the top part of the black line, and the bottom part of the spline forms
a nice arc inwards. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 49</font></b>)

<td><b>Technical Note</b>: Those who looked at <b>s-torso.lwo</b> earlier
might have noticed that this spline forms the entire side of a patch. Since
this spline cage will be patched with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots on
each patch, the extra two "tweak points" in Step 73 may seem like a waste
of geometry. Technically they are, since for a 2-by-2 operation all Knots
will pay attention to are the points that form the corners and the center
tweak point. (If no center tweak point exists, then Knots will treat the
center between the two centermost points of the spline border as the center
tweak point). The two extra points in Step 73 exist for:
<ol TYPE=a>
<li>
future patch operations (in case you want to try this spline cage out at
higher patch settings) and&nbsp;</li>

<li>
aesthetics -- that spline just <i>looks</i> weird without an extra tweak
point or two.</li>

<p><b>STEP 58</b>: The hip section is starting to take shape. Now to give
more shape to the rear. Enter Points Selection Mode. In the Right View,
select the "rightmost" points of the waist spline ellipse and the leg circle,
and type Ctrl-p to make a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 50</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 59</b>: Go to Polygon Selection Mode and select this new spline.
Use the Add Points tool to add a point to it. In the Right View use the
Drag tool to Drag the new point until the spline matches the shape of the
black line defining the rear. In the Back View, hold down the Ctrl key
and Drag the new point horizontally until the spline appears straight.
(<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 51</font></b>)
<p>That's it for the rear. The rear is now divided into two four-sided
spline boundaries. The front, however...well, to put it tactfully, the front
of the human hip area does not resemble the rear of the human hip area.
To use more expressive language: one's butt does not look like one's crotch.
<p>This part of the hip, then, needs a different "flow" of polygons, which
means using a different spline structure. No problem.
<p><b>STEP 60</b>: Deselect everything. In the Right View, select the spline
that defines the front of the hip section. Type c to Copy it. Go to an
empty layer and type v to Paste the copied geometry into the new layer.
<p><b>STEP 61</b>: Go into Points Selection Mode. Select the bottom point,
then type " (the double-quotes key) to Invert your selection (<b>Display
> Selection > Sel Invert</b>). Now everything but the lowest point should
be selected.

<td><b>Tip</b>: By not editing the lowest point, you won't have to do any
fancy Welding tricks to attach the lowest point to the center of the crotch,
since both points currently have the same XYZ coordinates.</td>

</table>

<p><b>STEP 62</b>: Type y to bring up the Rotate tool. In the Back View,
place your mouse pointer over the lowest point of the spline. Left-click
and drag to the right until the spline appears to point to the rightmost
corner of the waist. In the Right View, left-click on the lowest point
again and drag slightly to the right to lift the points away from the front
of the hip section. This will help keep the front of the hip section from
looking unusually flat. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 52</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 63</b>: Deselect everything. Type x to Cut this geometry out
of this layer. Return to the layer containing the hip section, and type
v to Paste this new spline on top of the hip section. Type m to Merge Points
(<b>Construct > Reduce > Merge Points</b>). You should see "1 point eliminated."
(If not, chances are the lowest point of the new spline got moved somehow.
Select the lowest point of the new spline, then select the point at the
center of the crotch, and type Ctrl-w to Weld the two together).
<p><b>STEP 64</b>: In the Right View, select the topmost point of the new
spline. Then, in the Back View, select the "rightmost" point of the waist
spline boundary. Type Ctrl-w to Weld these two points together into one
point. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 53</font></b>)

</table>

<p><b>STEP 65</b>: Go to Polygon Selection Mode. Select the newest spline.
In the Back View, use the Drag tool to move the three inner ("tweak") points
of this spline to the right, so that this line better resembles the contour
dividing the front of the leg from the front of the hip. (Or the cut of
a ladies' swimsuit, take your pick). (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 54</font></b>)
<p>Almost there. We have the contours defined, but everything needs to
be made up of three- or four-sided patches. The crotch spline, the "swimsuit"
spline, the two front splines of the leg circle, and the outermost hip
spline form a five-sided boundary. We could merge the two front splines
of the leg circle into one spline, and make a mental note&nbsp; to patch
that section (and the "swimsuit" section next to it) with 4-by-2 patches.
<p>Or we could add a spline that splits the would-be 4-by-2 patch into
two 2-by-2 patches. Let's do that now.
<p><b>STEP 66</b>: In Points Selection Mode, deselect all points. In the
Back View, select the middle point of the "swimsuit" spline. In the Right
View, select the "leftmost" point of the leg circle and type Ctrl-p to
make a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 55</font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 67</b>: In the Right View, select the center points of the "swimsuit"
spline and the spline that defines the front of the hip section. Type Ctrl-p
to make a spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000">Figure 56</font></b>)
<p>One final touch. Notice that on the model sheet, the legs angle outwards
from the hip. Since the leg circle forms the root of the leg, it ought
to do the same.
<p><b>STEP 68</b>: In Polygon Selection Mode, deselect everything, then
select the leg circle. Type y to bring up the Rotate tool. In the Back
View, place the mouse pointer over the "leftmost" point of the leg circle.
Left-click and drag to the left slightly, raising the outer edge of the
leg circle. Rotate about ten degrees, then stop.
<p>You have just completed the hip section! Now you must attach it to the
torso.
<p><b>STEP 69</b>: Go into Polygon Selection Mode and deselect everything.
Now select just those four splines that define the waist (in the shape
of an ellipse). Type the " key (the double-quotes key) to invert your selection.
Type c to Copy this geometry. Return to the layer that contains your upper
torso section. Type v to Paste the geometry.
<p><b>STEP 70</b>: Type m to Merge Points. It should say "3 points eliminated."
If less than three points were eliminated, check those points where the
hip splines join the waist spline. If what should be one point turns out
to be two points, Weld them together.
<p>This spline cage defines only half of the torso. Once patched, the patches
will be mirrored on the X axis. Then the points along the "seam" will be
merged. If the points along the seam lie right on top of each other, then
they can be merged with little fuss.
<p><b>STEP 71</b>: To make sure that the patches generated by this spline
cage can be Mirrored-and-Merged successfully, select all splines that lie
on the YZ plane, type Ctrl-v to bring up Set Value, choose 0m on the X
axis and click OK. The splines that lie on the YZ plane are:
<ol>
<li>
the spine</li>

<li>
the front of the chest</li>

<li>
the front of the neck</li>

<li>
the back of the neck</li>

<li>
the front of the hip</li>

<li>
the back of the hip</li>
</ol>

<p><br>The spline cage should now look like <b><font color="#CC0000">Figure
57</font></b>.
<p>One more thing. The hip currently has an interesting spline patching
problem, involving the area bordered by the waist spline, the front center
spline, the "swimsuit" spline, and the "divider" spline added in Step 83.
Depending on which spline is selected first, the Patch operation will either
work or it will tell you "Curves do not cross correctly."
<p>This is because the front center spline and the "swimsuit" spline share
a point at the crotch, past the "divider" spline. A Patch-able spline boundary
must be made up of three or four splines, joined at the corners -- but the
Patch operation may get confused as to which "corners" it should be using.
<p>The fix is to make it clear to the Patch operation where each spline
ends. We'll use the Split tool.
<p><b>STEP 72</b>: In Points Selection Mode, select the two points that
form the "divider" spline of Step 83. Enter Polygon Selection Mode and
deselect everything. In the Right View, select the front hip spline and
the "swimsuit" spline. Type Ctrl-l (that's a lowercase "L") to Split these
splines at the points selected in Points Selection Mode.
<p>The angles at the points where these splines have been Split look a
little too sharp. Since this spline cage will be Patched with low-resolution,
2-by-2 patches, this sharpness could be left alone. However, for aesthetic
reasons (and future spline patching), they ought to be Smoothed over. If
you try Smooth them all at once, though, you will get unwanted Smoothing
where the lower two splines join together at the center of the crotch.
It's better to Smooth one pair at a time.
<p><b>STEP 73</b>: Deselect the two splines that now form the "swimsuit"
spline. Type Ctrl-s to Smooth the remaining two selected splines. Deselect
everything, reselect the two splines that form the "swimsuit" spline, and
type Ctrl-s to Smooth.
<p><b>STEP 74</b>: Save this object right now as <b>torso04.lwo</b>.
