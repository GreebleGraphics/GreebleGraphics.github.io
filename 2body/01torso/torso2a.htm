<h3>
The Torso -- Spline Cage (Pt. 1)</h3>
Before we start, I'd like to give you a bit of a roadmap for the torso
spline cage. <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure 2</a></font></b>
shows front, side, and three-quarter views of the complete torso spline
cage. <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>
focuses on the upper portion without its neck, and <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b> focuses on the hip splines.

<p>For your reference, this spline cage is included on the CD-ROM as <b>s-torso.lwo</b>.
You may also copy its geometry into a background layer for guidance during
this part of the tutorial, if you wish.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Open Modeler. Make sure that the lower-left viewport
is set to the Back (XY) view and that the lower-right viewport is set to
the Right (ZY) view. Also make sure that the upper-left viewport is set
to the Top (XZ) view and that the upper-right viewport is set to the Perspective
view.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Type d to summon the Display Options panel. Left-click
on its Backdrop tab. In the Backdrop section, left-click on the Presets
drop-down menu, and select "Load Backdrop." Load the <b>kara.cfg</b> file
that you had saved when you set up Modeler's backdrops in the last section.
<p>You should now have images of the elf girl in the backdrop, ready to
trace.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Zoom in on the neck and torso area.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Longer Version</b>: LightWave gives you several options
for zooming in on a detail. I sometimes prefer using the hotkeys alone,
since it's quick and I don't have to deactivate the tool I'm currently
using or fuss with a titlebar button.
<p>Try this: in the lower-right viewport, move the mouse pointer over the
center of the elf's torso, and tap g on the keyboard. This will center
the views around the torso area. (By doing this in the Right view, the
Y axis remains perfectly centered in the Back view). Now tap on the > key
(technically, you should tap on the period key WITHOUT holding down the
Shift key, but it's easier to remember this key as the "greater than" sign).
<p>If you want to pan around your view, move your mouse pointer to the
Right view and hold down the left mouse button and the Alt key. As long
as you hold down the Alt key, you'll be able to pan around the view by
dragging the mouse pointer. (If you're in a Perspective view, you'll have
to hold down the Alt key as well as the Shift key to pan around the view).</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: For this model, make the neck, waist, and root of the
arm as rounded as possible. With splines, you need about eight points for
a perfect circle. The easiest way to create these points to use the Disc
tool. Left-click on the button for the Disc tool (<b>Objects > Primitives
> Disc</b>). Type n to activate its Numeric panel. Left-click on its Actions
drop-down menu and select Activate. Use the settings listed below (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>). (As you type in the following values, use the Tab key
to enter each value and advance to the next input field):
<pre><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axis: Y
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sides: 8
Segments: 1
&nbsp; Bottom: 0m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top: 0m
Center X: 0m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y: 0m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z: 0m
Radius X: 40mm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y: 0m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z: 40mm</font></pre>

<br><b>Figure 5</b>
<p>Exit the Numeric Panel by left-clicking on the button with the x mark
on it in the uppermost-right-hand corner of the window. The disc will still
have a blue bounding box around it. Left-click on the Disc button again,
and the bounding box will disappear.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: The blue bounding box means that the disc it surrounds
is not yet "set." If you were to deselect everything by left-clicking on
the blank grey areas on the toolbars, the disc will disappear. If you were
to do anything else (from using another tool to entering/re-entering one
of the Selection Modes), the disc will get fixed in place and its bounding
box will disappear.
<p>As long as the blue bounding box is active, you can still adjust the
placement and dimensions of the primitive geometry that you are creating.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Type k to kill the octagon you have just created, leaving
its points behind.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Type Ctrl-g to enter Point Selection Mode. Move your
mouse pointer to the Top view.
<p>We are going to create four three-point splines that together form the
shape of a circle. Because<b> the order in which you select points matters</b>,
it is <i>essential</i> that you select these points in the order that you
want the "line" of the spline to be "drawn." In this case, you must select
the points in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion, so as to define
the border of a circle.
<p>
<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: Think of point selection as a 3D version of connect-the-dots.
The order in which you select the points is the order in which the "line"
describing the spline curve will be "drawn."</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: In the Top view, left-click on the "topmost" point to
select it. Holding down the left mouse button, select the two points to
its right in a clockwise fashion (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b> and <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure
7</a></font></b>). Let go of the left mouse button. Type Ctrl-p to create
a spline.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Select the rightmost point and the next two points underneath
it in a clockwise fashion (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure
7</a></font></b>). Type Ctrl-p to create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Select the bottom point and the two points to its left
in a clockwise fashion. Type Ctrl-p to create a spline (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure
8</a></font></b>).
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Since the Top view has nothing to do with the
Y axis (which is what one might normally think of when referring to "up"
and "down"), "topmost" and "bottom" are used as relative terms here.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Select the leftmost point and the two points to its
right in a clockwise fashion. Type Ctrl-p to create a spline (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure
8</a></font></b>). You should now have a spline boundary that looks like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure 9</a></font></b>.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" >

<br><b>Figure 10</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 11</b>: From a distance you can't see it, but up close this
spline boundary looks slightly sharp at its "corners" (those points that
lie directly on the X and Z axes). Type Ctrl-h to enter Polygon Selection
Mode. The splines you have just created should automatically be selected
(in case they are not, select them now). Now type Ctrl-s to Smooth all
selected curves that share endpoints (<b>Detail > Curves > Smooth</b>).
Any trace of a corner on this spline boundary will now disappear (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure
10</a></font></b>).
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Each of the Smoothed splines are now made up of
five points, instead of three. To see this for yourself, select one and
copy it to another layer. When you paste it, you'll see a "three-point"
spline and two seemingly unattached points. When you select it, however,
you'll see dotted lines extending to the "unattached" points. These "unattached"
points act as control points of the ends of this spline, letting you tweak
the curves of the spline's ends. The dotted lines act as visual "handles."
<p>You can toggle control points on and off by using Ctrl-b and Ctrl-n.
Notice that those parts of the curve that run through the next-to-last
points remain the same whether or not the control points have been toggled
on or not. The dotted lines of the handles serve more than a cosmetic purpose,
however. If you try to use a spline for a Lathe, Rail Extrude, or Rail
Clone, those operations will only care about the non-handle portion of
the spline. Toggling spline handles on and off does makes a difference.
<p>Ctrl-b and Ctrl-n will work on any spline that you create. When it comes
to smoothing out a corner formed by two splines, though, let Ctrl-s do
all the work for you.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>You now have a spline boundary that describes a circle. We'll use copies
of this spline boundary for the elf's neck, waist, and arms.
