<h3>
The Torso – Patching</h3>
You did all of the hard work in the spline cage. Patching goes quickly,
once you get into a rhythm. When you Patch this cage, <b>every patch should
be set to 2-by-2 with Knots activated in both Parallel and Perpendicular</b>.
(<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig058.gif">Figure 58</a></font></b>)
Using the same settings on every single patch guarantees that all of the
seams will merge together perfectly.

<br><b>Figure 58</b>
<p>The one potentially tricky patch will be the triangular patch located
in the lower front of the crotch. The order in which you select the splines
controls where the triangles will end up (and thus, the “flow” of the polygons
in that area). For this patch, select the topmost spline last. That way
the triangles will point “down,” and the patch will look more aesthetically
pleasing.
<p>First, some steps to help you prep the torso for patching.
<p><b>STEP 75</b>: Load <b>torso04.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial and just want some patching practice, you
may load <b>torso04.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 76</b>: It doesn’t hurt to have the original available for reference.
Type c to Copy the torso spline cage, go to a new layer and type v to paste
a copy of the spline cage.
<p><b>STEP 77</b>: Enter Polygon Selection Mode. If any polygons are selected,
deselect them now. In the Back View, select the ten splines on the “left”
side of the Y axis (the model’s “right”) and type x to Cut them out. Some
points may appear to have been “left behind” – leave ‘em alone. They belong
to splines on the other side of the Y axis.
<p><b>STEP 78</b>: In the Right View, select all the splines that form
the “front half” of the spline cage. Type c to Copy this front half, go
into a new layer and type v to paste it.
<p><b>STEP 79</b>: Return to the previous layer. Now select all the splines
that form the “rear half” of the spline cage. Type c to Copy this rear
half. Go into still another new layer and type v to paste it.
<p>The point of splitting this spline cage into two separate halves is
to make it less confusing to patch. This way we’ll have less risk of selecting
the wrong spline.
<p>If you do not know how to Patch a spline cage and have not yet followed
the spline exercises from the CD-ROM, please do so now.
<p><b>STEP 80</b>: Go to the layer containing the rear half. For safety’s
sake, type m to Merge Points, and then type Shift-i to Unify any duplicate
polygons.
<p><b>STEP 81</b>: Patch each visible spline boundary with settings of
2-by-2 with Knots activated in both Parallel and Perpendicular. Some tips:
<ol>
<li>
Each spline boundary must be made up of three or four splines, sharing
the same points at the corners of the boundary.</li>

<li>
Once you’ve selected your four splines, type Ctrl-f to Patch them.</li>

<li>
Selecting the splines in a <i>counterclockwise</i> fashion makes the spline
patch face <i>towards</i> you. Selecting the splines in a <i>clockwise</i>
fashion makes the spline patch face <i>away</i> from you.</li>

<li>
Remember that this is the rear half of the model. If you’re Patching in
the Back View, make the spline patches face away from you.</li>

<li>
You can select your splines and Patch them in the Perspective View, if
you wish. The advantage of Patching in the Perspective View is that you
can rotate the model to whatever angle you like.</li>

<li>
Hold down the Alt key to rotate the Perspective View by left-clicking in
the Perspective View and dragging with the mouse pointer.</li>

<li>
Don’t worry if you accidentally select faces in addition to splines. All
that Patch looks at are the splines you selected.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><b>STEP 82</b>: When you have finished Patching, deselect everything.
Type w to bring up the Polygon Statistics panel (<b>Modeler > Windows >
Statistics Open/Close</b>). Left-click on the plus sign next to the word
“Faces.” All of the polygons you have just created will be selected. Close
the Statistics panel. Type x to Cut these polygons out of the spline cage.
Go to a new empty layer and type v to Paste these polygons into the new
layer. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig059.gif">Figure 59</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig059.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig059.GIF" ALT="Figure 59" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=71 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 59</b>
<p><b>STEP 83</b>: Go to the layer containing the front half of the spline
cage. Again, for safety’s sake, type m to Merge Points, and then type Shift-i
to Unify any duplicate polygons.
<p><b>STEP 84</b>: Patch everything here with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots
activated in both Parallel and Perpendicular.
<p><b>STEP 85</b>: Again, you have finished Patching, deselect everything.
Type w to bring up the Polygon Statistics panel and use it to select all
the Faces in this layer. Type x to Cut these polygons out of the spline
cage. Go to the layer containing the Faces for the rear half of the model,
and type v to Paste these polygons into that layer. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig060.gif">Figure
60</a></font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 86</b>: Later on in this chapter, you will use Smooth Shift
to “grow” the arms and legs. Before you can use Smooth Shift, however,
you will need something to “shift.” Polygons, specifically. Go to the layer
containing the original, whole spline cage – and its unbroken arm and leg
spline circles. These spline circles are each made of four splines joined
at four “corners” – ready to patch. Patch each circle with settings of
2-by-2, with Knots activated in both Parallel and Perpendicular. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig061.gif">Figure
61</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 87</b>: When you have patched both circles, deselect everything.
Type w to bring up the Polygon Statistics panel, select all the Faces in
this layer, and type x to Cut them out of the spline cage. Go to the layer
containing the Faces for the rest of the torso, and type v to Paste the
arm- and leg-circle polygons into that layer.&nbsp; It should look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig062.gif">Figure
62</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 88</b>: Because you used the same settings for every single
edge, and the same spline cage for every single edge, the points of every
single edge line up perfectly. It looks like a seamless mesh. However,
it is not yet truly seamless. These patches line up with each other, but
they are not connected to each other. To see proof of this, press the Tab
button on your keyboard to convert these Faces into SubPatches. You will
see gaps between the corners of every patch.
<p><b>STEP 89</b>: Type m to bring up the Merge Points panel. Choose “Automatic”
and left-click on OK. The mesh will become seamless, and the gaps will
disappear. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig063.gif">Figure 63</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 90</b>: It will be both faster and easier to work with polygons
instead of SubPatches right now, so hit the Tab key again to turn all SubPatches
back into Faces.
<p><b>STEP 91</b>: Save this object as <b>torso05.lwo</b>.
