<h3>
&nbsp;The Torso -- Breast</h3>
Time to add some details to this cage.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso06.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice the art
of Smooth Shift, you may load<b> torso06.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM). Ignore
the spline layers. Go to the layer that contains the left half of the torso.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Set the Perspective window's display to Wireframe Shade.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: One of the best new features of LightWave, Wireframe
Shade lets you perceive a model as both wireframe (with clearly outlined
polygons) and shaded volume at the same time - useful for helping you untangle
convoluted geometry, or for finding points that have gone astray. For celshader
artists, Wireframe Shade has the additional benefit of lettting you "preview"
the possible ink lines of your model, since Edges occur only on the edges
of polygons.</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 3</b>: The round form of a breast can be Smooth-Shifted from
an eight-point circle. To help us move the points of the chest into the
shape of a circle, let's first create a guide for the base of the breast.
We have a perfect eight-point circle on the end of the stump of the arm.
Select the four polygons that form the flat part of the stump of the arm,
and type c to Copy them. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Go to an empty layer and type v to Paste these four polygons.
(<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure 2</a></font></b>)
Select these same polygons, then hold down the Shift key and select the
layer containing the torso. You can now see both layers in the Perspective
window.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Type t to bring up the Move tool. Move the disc guide
to the front of the chest, between the four polygons of the chest that
surround the breast on the model sheet. Type Shift-h to bring up the Size
tool. Size the disc until it just fits within the previously mentioned
four polygons of the chest that surround the breast on the model sheet.
Type y to bring up the Rotate tool. Rotate this disc until it appears to
lie as flat as possible on the four polygons that surround the breast.
Use a combination of Move, Size, and Rotate to get this disc to look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>.

<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Artist's Note</b>: The size of this guide will determine
the initial "cup size." The angle of this guide will determine the initial
orientation of the breast. (If it points outwards at a 45-degree angle,
for example, the breast will also point outwards at a 45-degree angle).
The placement of this disc will determine the initial placement of the
base of the breast on this elf-girl's chest.
<p>Don't worry if you make a "mistake" - this guide disc just sets the
initial direction. You can always tweak the geometry later, so just make
the best guess possible for now. Use your sense of anatomy and design to
decide how big the breast should be (Size tool), what direction it should
point in (Rotate tool), and where it should start on the chest area (Move
tool).
<p>And stop blushing.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<br>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Technical Note</b>: Do not exceed the boundaries set by
the four polygons that currently form the "breast area" of the chest. In
fact, make the guide slightly smaller, as in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>, in order to give the points surrounding the breast some
"breathing room." Points spaced too closely together will cause sharp angles
in the curves of the SubPatches - inappropriate for an area like this.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Make the disc guide layer a background layer again, and
make the torso layer the foreground layer. In the Right View, select the
four polygons in the front of the chest that surround the disc guide. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>) Type Shift-f to summon the Smooth Shift tool (<b>Multiply
> Extend > Smooth Shift</b>). Move the pointer over the selected polygons,
and right-click on them once. You have just inserted geometry inbetween
these selected polygons and the points surrounding them, as the next step
will demonstrate.

<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Do not deselect these polygons. Type Ctrl-t to activate
the Drag tool. Left-click on each of the points on the corners of the selected
polygons...and Drag each of them in both the Back and Right Views, until
they match the position of the points nearest to them on the disc guide
in the background layer. The torso geometry should now look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: With these four polygons still selected, type Shift-f
to activate the Smooth Shift tool again. Move your pointer over the selected
geometry. This time, left-click on this selected geometry and drag to the
right until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure

its Size.</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Let's see how it looks in SubPatch Mode. To keep these
polygons selected while converting everything into SubPatches, go into
Points Selection Mode, deselect all points, and hit the Tab key to convert
everything into SubPatches. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure

<p>We've roughed out the form of the breast -- now we must fine-tune it.
If the profile of the breast in the Perspective looks conical instead of
hemispherical, the following two steps should take care of it. A cartoon
figure should look as "rounded" as possible, if only because it will look
better when celshaded.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Return to Polygon Selection Mode. The four polygons
at the center of the breast should still be highlighted. Type t to bring
up the Move tool. In the Right View, holding down the Ctrl key to restrict
movement to one axis, raise the four polygons until they look "centered"
in the profile view of the Perspective window. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig011.gif">Figure
11</a></font></b>) Then, in the Top View, move them slightly to the left
and back - the opposite of the direction that they are facing. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig011.gif">Figure
11</a></font></b>) Now the breast is starting to look more rounded and
spherical.
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Type t again to turn off the Move tool. Hold down the
Shift key and select the eight polygons that surround the four polygons
currently selected. Type t yet again to reactivate the Move tool. Rotate
the Perspective view until you see the profile of the breast. Then, in
the Perspective view, Move the selected polygons towards the torso. Stop
when the breast looks more like a hemisphere, and less like a rounded cone.
(<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig012.gif">Figure 12</a></font></b>)

</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Yet a true breast is not a perfect hemisphere. If anything,
it looks more like a teardrop. Deselect everything. Go into Points Mode.
Hit the Tab key to turn everything back into polygons. (There are two points
that you must select, and turning the SubPatches back into Faces it easier
for this tutorial to point them out to you).
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Look at the eight points that form the base of the breast.
Select the topmost point, then the point right above it. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig013.gif">Figure
13</a></font></b>) In the Right View, use the Move tool to raise these
points up slightly, until they form a gentle arc with the points on either
side of them.
<p><b>STEP 17</b>: If you converted these faces back into SubPatch surfaces
now, you would notice that the profile of the breast looks much better.
