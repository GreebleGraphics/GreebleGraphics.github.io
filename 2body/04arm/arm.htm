<h3>
The Torso -- Arm</h3>
<b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso07.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not follow
the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice Smooth Shift,
you may load <b>torso07.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM). Ignore the spline and
disc guide layers. Go to the layer that contains the left half of the torso.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Type a to Autosize the views. Then, in the Back View,
hold down the Alt key, left-click on the Back View, and drag your view
around until you can see the whole arm in the model sheet.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Select the four SubPatches at the very end of the stump
of the arm. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure 1</a></font></b>)
Type Shift-f to bring up Smooth Shift. Right-click on the selected polygons
once to create new geometry. Type t to bring up the Move tool. In the Back
View, Move the points of the polygons to the wrist in the model sheet (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>). Don't worry if the SubPatches themselves appear to be
lagging behind - worry about the point placement, first.

<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Deselect all polygons. Type Shift-k to summon the Knife
tool (<b>Construct > Subdivide > Knife</b>). In the Back View, move your
mouse pointer to the middle of the elbow, but above the polygonal cage.
Holding down the Ctrl key to restrict mouse movement to one axis, left-click
and drag the mouse pointer straight down, slicing through the cage as you
go. Each polygon you Knife through will be subdivided into two polygons
-- as long as you cut through the entire polygon.&nbsp; Make sure you cut
through the entire arm. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>) If you stop partway, you will leave behind some polygons
with more than four points -- such polygons cannot be turned into SubPatches.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: You have just set a specific length and direction for
the Knife tool. Move your mouse pointer to the middle of the upper arm
and right-click. (If you hold down the right mouse button when you click,
then you can still adjust the position of this cut. If you let go of the
right-mouse button, you can still adjust the cut by left-clicking and dragging
that part of the blue line that lies outside of the geometry). Then move
your mouse pointer to the middle of the forearm and right-click. It should
look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=83 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Select the outermost four rows of points. Activate the
Taper 1 tool (<b>Modify > Stretch > Taper</b>). In the Back View, right-click
on the center of the root of the arm, hold down the right mouse button
and drag to the right until the mouse pointer reaches the wrist. Then let
go of the right mouse button. You should have seen a pale blue triangle
being dragged out with the mouse pointer. This triangle represents the
Taper tool's area of influence, with the widest part of the triangle representing
the greatest amount of influence, and the tapered end representing the
least amount of influence. You can still adjust this triangle by right-clicking
on and dragging its ends around in any of the View windows. In the Top
View, right-click and drag each end of the triangle to the center of the
arm. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: In the Right View, move the mouse pointer over the center
point of the stump of the wrist. Left-click and drag to the left until
the row of points in the center of the forearm touch the black lines of
the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Deactivate the Taper tool. Select the row of points that
define the wrist. Type h to bring up the Stretch tool. In the Back View,
move the mouse pointer to the center of the wrist. Holding down the Ctrl
key to restrict movement to one axis, left-click and drag down until the
points fit within the black lines of the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>)
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: By squashing the wrist into an oval <i>after</i>
the Knife cuts, you have ensured that the points made by those cuts (the
points at the elbow, central upper arm, and center of the forearm) form
circles. This is because the wrist points, generated from the circle of
the arm stump, also formed a circle, and the polygons connecting the wrist
points to the arm circle thus formed a round cylinder.
<p>Keeping the arm as smooth and as cylindrical as possible will make the
celshading look smoother and better.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: In the Back View, select the row of points in the center
of the upper arm (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b>). Type t to bring up the Move tool. Using the Ctrl key
to restrict movement to one axis, Move these points down until they lie
within the black lines that define the arm on the model sheet.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Deselect everything. Activate the Knife tool. Holding
down the Ctrl key to restrict movement to one axis, use the Knife tool
in the Back View to slice through the arm between the elbow and the center
of the forearm, along the inner edge of the glove. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure
7</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: Select the row of points that form the elbow. In the
Back View, use the Stretch tool to make the points fit within the black
lines of the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure
8</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Deselect everything. In the Back View, select the row
of points between the elbow points and the center of the forearm. Move
the mouse pointer to the Back View. Holding down the Alt key on your keyboard,
tap the up arrow button on your keyboard until the points (or at least
the SubPatch lines running through them) lie between the black lines of
the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>)
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: When holding down Alt, you can use the arrow keys
to nudge geometry around in increments equal to one-tenth of the current
grid size. If you need finer increments, you must Zoom in to a smaller
grid size.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>This arm is starting to take shape, but it needs more rows of points
around the elbow. Otherwise, this elbow won't be able to maintain its volume
when bent.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Deselect everything. Use the Knife tool to make two
cuts through the arm, one on either side of the row of points defining
the elbow. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure
10</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig010.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig010.GIF" ALT="Figure 10" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=81 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 10</b>
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: That's about it for the arm right now. Save this object
as <b>torso08.lwo</b>.
