<h3>
The Torso -- Mirroring</h3>
Time to mirror this thing.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso16.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice Mirroring,
you may load <b>torso16.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM). Zoom in on the center
of the body.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Type Shift-v to activate the Mirror tool. Type n to activate
its numeric panel. Select Activate from the drop-down list, choose X for
its axis, XYZ values of 0 0 0 for its center, and leave Merge Points turned
on. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure 1</a></font></b>)
Exit the numeric panel.

<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p><b>STEP 3</b>:&nbsp; Like all of Modeler's other interactive tools,
the Mirror effect will not be set in stone until you either deactivate
it, select another tool, or select another editing mode. Type Ctrl-h to
(re)select Polygons Selection Mode.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: The Merge Points may have merged the points on the center
seam of the model nicely, but it also merged all points on the mirrored
geometry as well, messing up the piping of the glove and the top of the
boot. Select the polygons that form the glove piping and the boot top,
Cut them out, and Paste them back into the layer. (Hint: if you had assigned
the Part Name of "Separate Mesh" to these parts, you can use the Polygon
Statistics panel to quickly select them again). (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b> and <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Do you see any gaps in the center of the model? Along the spine, along
the sternum, the crotch, the rear, the belly, the neck? If so, select all
center points, type Ctrl-v, set their values to 0m, and (with the points
still selected, so as not to affect geometry that we want to remain separate
from the mesh) type m to Merge Points. If you still see gaps, find each
separate pair of points and use Weld to stitch them together.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Save this model as <b>torso17.lwo</b>.
