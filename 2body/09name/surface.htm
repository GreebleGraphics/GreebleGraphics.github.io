<h3>
The Torso -- Surface Naming</h3>
We started assigning surface names in the last tutorial section -- let's
finish what we started.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso13.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you did not
follow the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice assigning
surface names, you may load <b>torso13.lwo</b> off the CD-ROM). Go to the
layer that contains the body.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Select the topmost row of polygons at the neck, and type
q to bring up Change Surface. Call this surface "Kara Face," with Smoothing
turned on and the same RGB values you used for "Kara Skin" (such as 204
183 167).
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Making the face a separate surface from the rest
of the skin can make it easier for you to map extra details onto the face,
since you would be surfacing less geometry. "Extra details" might include
color maps for blusher (such as the cheeks of the main character in <i>Kiki's
Delivery Service</i>) or tattoos (such as the teardrop tattoo on Folken's
face in the <i>Escaflowne</i> television series).
<p>They might also include diffuse maps and bump maps to control the shading
of the character's face. Because the face has a more complex form than
the rounded shapes that form the rest of the character, it can be the most
challenging surface to celshade.
<p>Sometimes, the shading on a humanoid face can look too erratic for something
that's supposed to be stylized. If the shading of a particular face looks
unattractive no matter what, you can "cheat" by removing all shading from
the face and flat-shading it by making it 100% Luminous and 0% Diffuse.
A cheat, but one that makes it tougher for the audience to figure out the
illusion -- especially if the rest of the body has celshading on it..</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Deselect everything. Select the polygons shown in (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>), and assign the "Kara Glove" surface to it.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=152 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b></td>

<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig002.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig002.GIF" ALT="Figure 2" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=152 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 2</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Deselect everything. Select the polygons shown in (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>), and assign a new surface called "Kara Boot" to it, with
Smoothing turned on and a brown color for now, (such as RGB 128 064 000).
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Deselect everything. In Polygon Selection Mode, type
w to bring up Polygon Statistics. The second text string from the bottom
should start with "Surf:" -- left-click on it to reveal a drop-down list
of all the surfaces in this object. Select "Default" from the list. Then
left-click on the plus sign to the left of "Surf:" to select all polygons
that are currently assigned the "Default" surface. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=249 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b></td>

<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig004.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig004.GIF" ALT="Figure 4" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=152 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 4</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Assign a new surface to these selected polygons, called
"Kara Silk" -- with Smoothing turned on and an off-white color for now (such
RGB 202 201 194). (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Save this object as <b>torso14.lwo</b>.
