<h3>
About Modeler</h3>
There is no "Art" button.
<p>LightWave models are made of polygons, so every tool in Modeler will
help us create and edit polygonal geometry. We can create anything we want
in Modeler, but Modeler cannot read our mind. We must know what we want
to model before we start.

button. Novels are made of words, so every tool in WordProcessor will help
us create and edit English sentences. We can write anything we want in
WordProcessor, but WordProcessor cannot read our mind. We must know what
we want to write before we start."</blockquote>
