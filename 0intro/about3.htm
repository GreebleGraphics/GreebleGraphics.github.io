<h3>
About Modeling</h3>
A modeler needs both artistic and technical judgement.
<p>When given a two-dimensional drawing of a character, a modeler must
draw upon both anatomical knowledge and a sense of aesthetics to design
the volume of the figure. Even when given both drawings and a three-dimensional
maquette of a character, the modeler must <i>still</i> design a polygonal
mesh that best translates the character into a computer model.
<p>A model that has too many polygons will slow down both interactivity
and render times. So, the modeler must keep efficiency in mind, using as
few polygons as possible without sacrificing quality. However, in some
instances using <i>more</i> polygons will speed up render times (e.g.:
subdividing the floor of a furnished room) and interactivity (e.g.: Tripling
a point-heavy "n-gon").
<p>Modelers thus make a judgement call with every button pushed, with every
point edited. With each button pushed, the modeler decides: "This gets
me the results I want in the shortest amount of time." With each point
edited, the modeler thinks: "This makes the model look better."
<p>Experimentation teaches us <i>how</i> to use each tool in Modeler, but
experience will teach us <i>when</i> to use each tool.

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: In this tutorial, we will spend more time editing
existing points and polygons than creating new ones. Learn how to select
geometry quickly in Modeler, because most of the time you will want a tool
to affect only <i>part</i> of the model, not <i>all</i> of it.
<p>&nbsp;The Display tab has great Selection tools. It also has Visibility
tools devoted towards Hiding selected/unselected areas from your sight,
so that you may have an uncluttered view of what you want to change.</blockquote>
