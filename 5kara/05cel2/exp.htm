<h3>
The Super Cel Shader – Experimentation</h3>
First, let’s just mess around. Loosen up. See what those “Brightness” and
“Min/Max” settings in the Super Cel Shader actually <i>do</i>.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Open LightWave Layout. Load kara03.lwo into Layout. (If
you have not built kara03.lwo from the previous tutorials, you may load
her from the CD-ROM). We want to clearly see all of the dark ink lines
that we will use, so set the Backdrop Color (<b>Scene > Effects > Backdrop</b>)
to RGB 255 255 255. We also want the lighting to look as dramatic and “cool”
as possible, so set the Ambient Intensity (<b>Lights > Global > Amb Intensity</b>)
to 0.0%. (Ambient Intensity lighting tends to “wash out” most of the shadows
on an object, celshaded or not. The Super Cel Shader <i>interprets</i>
and <i>simplifies</i> shading – it cannot <i>add</i> shading).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: We want as good a view of the subject as possible. Increase
the Camera Zoom and move the camera so that the model fills the entire
Camera View. Set a key for the camera and tap F9 for a test render. It
should look something like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>. Save this scene file as <b>kara01.lws</b>.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Open up the Surface Editor. Select “Kara Glove” from
the list of surfaces in the Surface Name column. From the Shaders tab,
select LW_SuperCelShader from the “Add Shader” drop-down list. “SuperCelShader
2.13” will be added to the list of shaders applied to this surface, and
the formerly soft, gradient shading on the preview sphere will be simplified
into three shades of brown. Hit F9 for a test render if you wish – notice
that Kara’s gloves now render with only two or three shades of brown.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Double-click on “SuperCelShader 2.13” to bring up its
options panel. Ignore “Use Light Colors,” “Specular Highlights,” and “Bumped
Edges” for now. Just focus on the ten sliders at the top – the ones listed
under Zones 1-4. It may seem like a lot of sliders…but notice that each
slider controls one of three settings: “Min,” “Max,” and “Brightness.”
Also notice that the ten controls fall into one of four “Zones” – Zone
1 Diffuse, Zone 2 Diffuse, Zone 3 Diffuse, and Zone 4 Diffuse.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Let’s experiment with “Brightness” for now. Each of the
four Zones has its own Brightness setting. Note that though four Zones
exist, the sphere appears to have only three shades of brown on it. Then
note that the Brightness for Zone 1 happens to have the same setting that
of Zone 2 – a value of 40.0%. Left-click on the Brightness slider for Zone
1 and replace that 40% value with different numbers – all the while keeping
an eye on the preview sphere. Try setting Zone 1’s Brightness to 0%; then
try setting it to 100%. You should see the darkest band of shading on the
preview sphere split up into two adjacent bands, as Zone 1 reveals its
location by getting brighter and darker with higher and lower Brightness
values. Try adjusting the Brightness settings for the other three Zones
in the same way – note that the shading of each Zone gets lighter or darker
with higher or lower Brightness settings.
<p>Yet no matter how many times you adjust the Brightness settings, the
Zones always stay the same size. The Brightness setting for each Zone controls
how light or dark that shading appears…but what controls the <i>amount</i>
of shading? What controls the <i>size</i> of a Zone on an object?
<p>You guessed it – those other two settings: Min and Max.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Let’s experiment with the “Min” and “Max” settings. Increase
the “Min” value next to “Zone 3 Diffuse” to 60.0%. You should see the middle
border of the shading (the border that separates Zone 2 from Zone 3) soften
into a gradient between the two. Now increase Zone 2’s “Max” value to 60%
(if you use the slider and accidentally go over 60%, notice that the “Min”
value for Zone 3 will increase along with Zone 2’s “Max” value). With Zone
2’s “Max” set to the same value as Zone 3’s “Min,” the border between the
two hardens, becoming crisp and distinct.
<p>The bigger the difference between the Max of a lesser Zone and the Min
of a greater Zone, the softer the border between them will be (think of
airbrushing, or the digital blending between the shades of color on the
characters’ skin in Dreamworks’ <i>Prince of Egypt</i>). The smaller the
difference, the harder the border between them will be (think of the hard
distinctions between shades of color on most hand-painted cels, such as
those used for older Japanese animated television shows).
<p>Differences greater than 0%, however, risk the look of “smudged paint”
between Zones on some models. If the model has indistinct areas of light
and shadow upon any part of its surface (whether due to lighting or to
an uneven, slightly “bumpy” surface), consider making the Max value of
each Zone equal to the Min value of the next higher Zone. This restricts
you to “hard” borders, but it may be preferable to have "hard" shading
than unattractive shading.

<blockquote><b>The English translation for a Zone that has a Min of 10%,
a Max of 35%, and a Brightness of 80%</b>: “If the pixel in question receives
an amount of light between 10 and 35 percent, then said pixel will render
as though it receives 80 percent light.”
<p><b>Alternate English translation for a Zone that has a Min of 10%, a
Max of 35%, and a Brightness of 80%</b>: “If the pixel in question is between
10 to 35 percent lit, then the RGB values of that pixel will be multiplied
by 80 percent. For example, if the pixel in question is between 10% and
35% lit, and that pixel’s color values are RGB 100 200 50, then it will
render with an RGB value of 80 160 40 – 80 percent of each red, green and
blue channel in RGB 100 200 50.”</blockquote>
