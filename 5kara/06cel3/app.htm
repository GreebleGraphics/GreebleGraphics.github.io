<h3>
The Super Cel Shader -- Application</h3>
In our elf-girl, “Kara Face” shares a border with “Kara Silk” at the neckline.
To help cast the illusion that “Kara Silk” clings tightly to the body (as
though made of paper-thin spandex), it might be a good idea to make their
shadows line up with each other. You can do this by giving them the same
Diffuse settings, the same Bump settings, and (for their Super Cel Shader
settings) the same Min/Max values for each Zone. That way, each surface
will shade in exactly the same way under the same amount of light.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: When trying to decide how much “shadow” should
cover a celshaded surface, consider studying actual traditional cel animations.
If you have the means, study an actual cel. Find books with stills from
animated features. Those with Web access can also search online for sites
with pictures or even entire online cel galleries. Find a style of colors
and shading that appeals to you, and see if you can recreate it in LightWave.
(Some starting suggestions for color and shading reference: <i>Iron Giant</i>,
<i>Princess
Mononoke</i>, and <i>Castle of Cagliostro</i>).</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>kara01.lws</b> into LightWave Layout. (If you
did not follow the previous tutorial section, follow its first two steps
now. If you have not yet followed any of the previous tutorial sections,
you may load <b>kara01.lws</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>:&nbsp; Go to frame 10. Move the Camera so that it has
a good view of our elf-girl’s head and shoulders, and set a key for the
Camera at that frame. Go to <b>Rendering > Render Options > Rendering</b>
and activate “Ray Trace Shadows.” Hit F9 for a test render. It should look
like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure 1</a></font></b>.
Pay attention to the areas of light and shadow on this object – because
the Super Cel Shader will pay attention to them as well.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 3</b>:&nbsp; Go to the Surface Editor. First, make sure every
surface listed under “kara03” in the Surface Name list has its Smoothing
turned on in the Basic tab. Then select “Kara Face” from the list of Surface
Names under “kara03.” Go to the Shaders tab and select “LW_SuperCelShader”
from the drop-down list called “Add Shader.” Don’t change its default settings
right now – instead hit F9 for a test render. It should look like…hm, it
should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure 2</a></font></b>.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: When celshading, plan on using the default settings
for the Super Cel Shader (or its LightWave 7.0 successor, BESM) about as
often as you use the default Basic settings for a surface – sparingly.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Time to get serious. In the lower-left corner of the
Surface Editor, left-click on the button marked “VIPER.” (If you can, indulge
yourself a little and set its Preview Size to 640x480. If your machine
balks at this, or if you don’t have enough screen space for such a large
window, or even if you just prefer faster feedback, you may leave it at
the less-intense default setting of 320x240. Smaller sizes may give you
faster feedback…but the larger size will let you see more shading detail).
Hit F9 for another render – and to give VIPER a chance to snag the information
it needs. After the render has finished, left-click on the button marked
“Render” in the VIPER window to load the render information into VIPER.
<p>Let’s place our shadows. Right now our elf-girl has too much shadow
on her face (granted, the only light in this scene has been left at its
default position, so the Super Cel Shader is not entirely to blame for
this. Still, let’s improve the way this surface interprets light and shadow).
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Leave the VIPER window open, so that you can see what’s
going on. In the Shaders tab of the Surface Editor, double-click on “SuperCelShader
2.13” to go into its options. First, set the Brightness of Zone 3 to 100%,
so that it has the same shading as Zone 4. That brightened things up a
bit, but the contrast between light and dark now looks harsh. Lighten the
shadow by raising the Brightness settings of Zones 1 and 2 to 85%. Better…but
the shadow still covers too much of the face. Decrease the Max value of
Zone 2 to 20%. Okay, but the 25% difference between the Max of Zone 2 and
the Min of Zone 3 makes the border between the two look soft. If the amount
of softness remained consistent along the entire border, it might pass
for the look of modern digital ink-and-paint packages. As it is, the amount
of softness increases as the border stretches towards the ear, and decreases
as the border runs towards the chin. An even more rounded and stylized
character might have been able to get away with a soft border between shadows.
For our elf-girl, however, set the Min value for Zone 3 to 20%. Now the
shading jumps immediately from Zone 2 to Zone 3, and the borders now look
distinct. Your Super Cel Shader settings should now look like this:
<pre><font face="Courier New,Courier">Zone 1 Diffuse: Max: 0.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 85.0%
Zone 2 Diffuse: Min: 0.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max: 20.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 85%
Zone 3 Diffuse: Min: 20.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Max: 95.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 100.0%
Zone 4 Diffuse: Min: 100.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 100.0%</font></pre>
<b>STEP 6</b>:&nbsp; Now that we have placed our shadows, let’s try to
fine-tune the color of this surface. It looks a bit too bright. Exit the
Super Cel Shader interface, and return to the Basic tab of the Surface
Editor. Change its Color to RGB 170 151 141.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you think this color looks a bit subdued, you
are correct. The lower saturation makes the rendered surface even more
video-friendly (and, for some printers, perhaps more printer-friendly).
Various television standards do not take kindly to highly saturated colors.&nbsp;
Pure reds, magentas, and blues (which may look fine on a computer monitor)
tend to smear when converted to a video signal (ie: RGB 255, 0, 0). As
a rule-of-thumb, keep RGB values between 20 and 235 when creating content
for video.
<p>The lower saturation also attempts to mimic the look of an older cel
animation that actually used cels. When trying to mimic the colors of older
cel animations, keep in mind that while the ink went on the top of the
cel, the paint went on the back of the cel and was seen <i>through the
cel</i>. If you have ever seen transparencies from the local office supply
store, then you know that the “clear” plastic of a transparency slightly
desaturates the color of surfaces seen through it. The same thing happened
with traditional cels.
<p>That said, don’t ever feel as though you <i>must</i> imitate palettes
of the past. Always use the colors that <i>you</i> think look best. (Even
the most zealous of cel animation fans should take note that modern digital
ink-and-paint packages allow cel artists to use any color that they want
– along with special effects normally associated with “CG,” such as motion
blur!)</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: When trying to match the look of cel animation,
consult books on color and on cel animation for tips, and use a color picker
on frame grabs of a specific cel animation that you want to match.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: This face has no texture maps on it, so its surface settings
can double as the settings for the “Kara Skin” surface as well. In the
“Surface Name” list, right-click on “Kara Face” and select “Copy” from
the drop-down list that appears. Then select “Kara Skin” from the “Surface
Name” list, right-click on its name, and select “Paste” from the drop-down
list that appears. You have just copied all of the settings for “Kara Face”
onto “Kara Skin.”
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: The “Kara Silk” surface should have the same Super Cel
Shader settings as “Kara Face,” if its shadows are to line up. However,
LightWave 6.5 cannot copy shaders from one surface to another.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: LightWave 7.0 <i>can</i> copy and paste shaders
from one surface to another. The following steps are for those working
with LightWave 6.5, but 7.0 users may copy and paste the shader itself,
rather than the entire surface setting.
<p>Use the fastest method that gives you the best results.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>Adjusting ten Super Cel Shader settings seems less convenient than writing
down and later adjusting three RGB settings, so select “Kara Silk” from
the list of surfaces and write its current RGB settings down on a piece
of scrap paper.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: If you are using the Color picker that comes with
LightWave and happen to be short of scrap paper, consider this trick. Use
the “Add to Custom Colors” button to temporarily store the RGB values of
the “Kara Silk” surface in one of the squares listed under “Custom colors”
in the lower-left hand corner of the Color panel. You can later left-click
on that square to load those RGB values back into the surface.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: The settings for “Kara Face” should still be listed in
memory, so right-click on the selected listing for “Kara Silk” and Paste
the settings for “Kara Face” – Super Cel Shader and RGB values alike --
into “Kara Silk.” This elf now looks ready to start shivering, so change
the RGB values of “Kara Silk” back to their previous values. Or, change
them to something new altogether. Try RGB 200 216 216 for a blue-white
look.
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Now for the hair. The rounded form of the hair geometry
lends itself well to celshading…and shading tricks. If you want to keep
the color you picked while modeling, write down the RGB values of “Kara
Hair” onto paper. Then Copy and Paste the settings of one of the celshaded
surfaces onto the “Kara Hair” surface. It now has Super Cel Shader settings
that match that of the other celshaded surfaces, but the wrong color. Change
its RGB values to the ones it had before the Copy and Paste operation,
or to any hair color that you like.
<p><b>STEP 11</b>:&nbsp; This might look fine right now, but the shading
doesn’t do much to distinguish one hair tuft from another. To see how the
following trick will work, go into the Shaders tab and remove the checkmark
next to “SuperCelShader 2.13” to deactivate it (you can reactivate it later).
Return to the settings listed under the Basic tab, and left-click on the
“T” button next to Diffuse to enter the Texture Editor for that setting.
Change the available Layer Type to Gradient, then change the Input Parameter
to “Incidence Angle.” Left-click near the bottom of the gradient bar to
create a new key at the very end, and set its Value to 0.0%. Now the hair
surface will receive 100% of all light at its edges and 0.0% of all light
that hits those polygons that face the camera directly, with a gradient
for everything in between. Click on “Use Texture” to exit this panel. Return
to the “Shaders” tab and reactivate the Super Cel Shader by replacing its
checkmark. The hair now appears to be “rim-lit.” Return to the Texture
Editor, and raise the Value of the key at the bottom to raise the amount
of “rim lighting” on the hair. Stop when it looks good to you.
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: Let’s add a specular highlight to this hair. Make the
hair 100.0% Specular, with 19.0% Glossiness. Then go into the Super Cel
Shader settings. To get a hint of how the Super Cel Shader thinks, deactivate
“Specular Highlights” to see the “normal” LightWave specular highlights.
Super Cel Shader interprets specular highlights in the same way that it
interprets shading – it simplifies what it “sees.” Here, Super Cel Shader
looks at the intensity of the existing specular highlight.
<p>The Min and Max default to 30% and 50%, respectively. Their default
settings mean the following in English: “Any pixel that has a specular
highlight with an intensity of 50% or higher shall have an opaque shade
of color representing cartoon specularity. This shade of color shall be
specified by the Brightness and Saturation settings. Any pixel whose specular
highlight intensity ranks as less than 30% shall not have a cartoon specular
highlight. All pixels inbetween shall have a blend of the specular highlight
color with the surface colors underneath, with their specular highlight
opacity increasing with the amount of specular intensity.”
<p>In layman’s terms, Max sets the range of solid “paint,” and the difference
between it and Min will set the falloff of that paint. The Min value must
be the same as or less than Max. The larger the difference between Max
and Min, the softer the edge of the specular highlight. If their values
are the same, you will get a hard edge to the highlight.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Turn Specular Highlights back on. Set both its Min and
Max values to 90.0%. It now has a hard edge to its border. The Specular
Highlights “paint color” is itself a shade of the hair color – its “Brightness”
value acts the same as do the Brightness values for the Zones. The Saturation
value is a nice touch, though – set it to 10.0% to further grey out the
paint, and make it look more off-white than yellow. To set off the brightness
of the highlight paints, further darken the Brightness of Zones 1 and 2
to 70%.
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Copy and Paste the settings for “Kara Hair” onto “Kara
Eyebrow.” Reduce the specularity for “Kara Eyebrow” to 0.0% to prevent
odd-looking specular highlights from appearing on the eyebrow. The face
has the same shadow borders as defined with the Super Cel Shader’s “Min”
and “Max,” but it does not have a gradient in its Diffuse channel. If you
want the eyebrow’s shading to perfectly match that of the face, remove
the texture from its Diffuse channel.
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Now for the eyes. Copy and Paste the settings for “Kara
Silk” to “Kara Eye White,” and tweak to taste. For example, increasing
its Zone 2 Max setting to 70% (this will automatically update Zone 3’s
Min setting to 70% as well) will increase the amount of “shadow” on the
eye whites.
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Copy and Paste the settings for “Kara Eye White” to
“Kara Iris (Left)” and “Kara Iris (Right).” Eep, scary! Change their Colors
to anything you like.
<p><b>STEP 17</b>: Not bad, but she’s starting to look like one of the
characters from Revolutionary Girl Utena. Go into the Color texture channel
for “Kara Iris (Left).” It should already be set to “Image Map” for its
Layer type, so all you need to do is specify an actual image. From the
drop-down list next to “Image,” select “(load image).” Load iris1.png from
the CD-ROM. Texture Axis should be set to Z. Click on “Automatic Sizing”
to fit this image to the size of the iris. Turn off Texture Antialiasing
(otherwise this image will look “fuzzy” when rendered) and set both Width
Tile and Height Tile to “Edge.” Click on “Use Texture” to exit the Texture
Editor.
<p><b>STEP 18</b>: Copy and Paste the settings for “Kara Iris (Left)” to
“Kara Iris (Right).” Then go into the Color texture channel for “Kara Iris
(Right)” and click on “Automatic Sizing” for the only layer in there, to
fit the image to the geometry for the right iris.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: The geometry of these irises angle outwards, and
do not point straight forward. However, because of the way planar image
mapping works, this character will not have the spaced-out, dumbfounded
look of The Simpsons’ Homer Simpson whenever she looks straight at the
camera. Her irises may look slightly oval, as will any disc when viewed
from an angle, but that will be all. Planar image mapping distorted this
image map in such a way that it looks flat when viewed from straight on,
even though the geometry tilts away at an angle.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 19</b>: Now for the mouth. It doesn’t need that much paint in
it – in fact, let’s try going with a single shade of “paint.” Simplest
way to recreate a flat shade of paint is by setting the Luminosity to 100%,
and the Diffuse to 0%. No need for the Super Cel Shader at all. So, set
the Luminosity for “Kara Mouth (Interior)” to 100.0%, 0.0% Diffuse, with
a color of RGB 150 100 090.
<p><b>STEP 20</b>: Select “Kara Eye Socket” from the Surface Name list.
It, too, doesn’t need Super Cel Shader – “Kara Eye Socket” represents ink,
not paint. Make it 100.0% Luminous, 0.0% Diffuse, and give it a color of
RGB 030 024 039 for a violet-black “ink.”
<p>Your VIPER window should now look similar to <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 21</b>: Go to frame 20. Move and Rotate the Camera so that you
have a full-figure view of the elf-girl, and set a key for the Camera at
that frame.
<p><b>STEP 22</b>:&nbsp; Type F9 for a test render. After the test render
has finished, click on the “Render” button in VIPER to load the render
information into VIPER. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b> – a curious sight, half-celshaded like that.
<p><b>STEP 23</b>: Let’s continue the line of shadow from “Kara Silk” to
“Kara Skin” through “Kara Glove” and “Kara Glove Trim.” Copy and Paste
the settings from “Kara Silk” to both “Kara Glove” and “Kara Glove Trim.”
Then set the colors of “Kara Glove” and “Kara Glove Trim” to whatever you
like. (Those in a hurry can just set “Kara Glove” to RGB 128 060 040 and
“Kara Glove Trim” to 200 150 060).
<p><b>STEP 24</b>: Reduce, reuse, recycle. Copy the settings for “Kara
Glove,” and Paste them onto the other brown surfaces in this model: “Kara
Boot,” “Kara Belt,” and “Kara Ponytail Holder.” Then Copy and Paste the
settings for “Kara Glove Trim” onto “Kara Belt Buckle.”
<p><b>STEP 25</b>: The boots could stand a little more shading. Go into
the Super Cel Shader settings for “Kara Boot,” and increase the Max of
Zone 2 to 50%.
<p><b>STEP 26</b>: Only two more surfaces to go. Select “Kara Tunic” from
the Surface Name list. Activate the checkbox next to “Double Sided” to
make it a double-sided surface, and change its color to RGB 168 050 071.
Apply Super Cel Shader and go into its options. Try these settings:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>Zone 1 Diffuse: Max: 0.0%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 67.0%

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightness: 130.0%</pre>
<b>STEP 27</b>: Copy and Paste the settings from “Kara Tunic” to “Kara
Tunic Trim.” Set the color of “Kara Tunic Trim” to RGB 182 146 078.
<p><b>STEP 28</b>: That should be it for celshading. Time to save your
work. Select kara03:Body from the Current Item list, and use File > Save
> Save Current Object to save it as <b>kara04.lwo</b>. Because it is a
layered object, all layers of this object will be saved along with it under
the name of <b>kara04.lwo</b>. Type F9 for a test render. She should now
look like

<h3>
The Finishing Touch -- Edges</h3>
And now for the crowning touch: Edges. These belong to the scene file (like
other object attributes such as Dissolve, Unseen By Rays, Unseen By Camera,
and shadow options), not the object file, so you will have to set them
for each scene that uses a celshaded object.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: If you have created a separate scene file that
has just the object and its Edges, then you can load items from that scene
with all of their Edges applied into the scene of your choice.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 29</b>: Go to frame 10, which has a close-up of your character’s
head and shoulders. Select kara04:Body from the list of objects, and type
p to enter the Item Properties for that object. Left-click on the Edges
tab to see the options available. Because every type activated will open
up opportunities for an unintentional ink line, we want to use the fewest
types of edges that gives us the results we want. For kara04:Body, activate
Silhouette Edges and Surface Borders. To make the ink line thinner for
Surface Borders, set the value for Surface Borders to 0.5 pixels. To lighten
up the ink line slightly, change the Edge Color to RGB 030 024 039.
<p><b>STEP 30</b>: Hit F9 for a test render. It might look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b>. If you’re using the model from the CD-ROM, notice the
strange heaviness of the ink around the inside of the eyebrow. An unwanted
Silhouette Edge lies there, because it sees an edge turning away from the
camera.

<p><b>STEP 31</b>: Let’s try to “smooth out” this model by going to the
Geometry tab increasing its Render SubPatch Level to 6. Type F9 for a test
render (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure 7</a></font></b>).
<p><b>STEP 32</b>: Almost perfect. If the lines still look unartistically
uneven, though, you might be seeing one too many of all possible Edges.
If so we have one final weapon: Edge Z Scale. Set the Edge Z Scale to its
maximum of 1.0. Type F9 for a test render, and the lines should look more
even, since we’re seeing less of them. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure

</table>

<p>To see all Silhouette and Surface Border Edges in this situation, set
the Object Dissolve in the Rendering tab to 50% for both kara04:Body and
kara04:Tunic, and type F9 for a render. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>.
<p>Observe, and realize this: LightWave has no artistic sense, any more
than does a pencil, pen, brush or chisel. LightWave, a logical thinker,
follows two rules. Opaque surfaces conceal Edges. Transparent surfaces
do not. Look at the line of the arm under the tunic. When the tunic was
opaque, you could not see this line. Yet there it was, all along, because
it met the qualifications for Silhouette Edges. (Some of these lines, such
as the ink lines of the ear, are still hidden behind the opaque surfaces
of the eyes. An object Dissolve of 50% on each of the eyes would make those
hidden ink lines visible, too).
<p>Reducing the Edge Z Scale makes more of these lines visible, by bringing
all of them closer to the camera. It works the other way around, too –
increasing the Edge Z Scale hides more of the lines by pushing all of them
away from the camera and further into the concealing opaque mesh of the
elf-girl.
<p>Set the Object Dissolve in the Rendering tab back to 0% for both kara04:Body
and kara04:Tunic. Then go to the Edges panel for kara04:Body and set its
Edge Z Scale to its minimum of 0.0, forcing it to reveal all of the lines
possible for this object. Type F9 for a render. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure

<p>Set the Edge Z Scale back to 1.0. Let’s take care of the tunic.
<p><b>STEP 33</b>: Make kara04:Tunic the current object. Activate Silhouette
Edges (for the belt and belt buckle), Unshared Edges (for the ends of the
sleeves), Surface Borders (to draw lines at the border between the “Kara
Tunic” and “Kara Tunic Trim” surfaces) and Sharp Creases (for everything
else). For fun, set the Edge Color to RGB 124 071 072. Set Unshared Edges
to a thickness of 2.5 pixels and Sharp Creases to 2.0 pixels. Hit F9 for
a test render. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig011.gif">Figure
11</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 34</b>: Go to frame 20, where you have a full-figure view of
the elf-girl in the Camera View. Let’s see how the Edges look at this distance.
Type F9 for a test render. It might look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig012.gif">Figure
12</a></font></b>. The ink line for the top of the belt is showing through
the belt buckle, so if we wanted to animate this elf-girl at this distance
from the camera, we might have to slightly increase the Edge Z Scale of
the tunic to hide the unwanted ink line. Too high of an increase might
cause the thicker ink lines to break up as they get pushed into the concealing
mesh of the opaque tunic. For this distance, set the Edge Z Scale to 0.999
or something higher than 0.998 but less than 1.0 -- enough to “fix” the
belt buckle without hurting the thicker ink lines.

<p><b>STEP 35</b>:&nbsp; At this distance, the thickness of the edges around
kara04:Body look a bit “heavy.” They’re still the same thickness as they
were when seen up-close to the camera. Make kara04:Body the current object.
In the Edges tab of the Object Properties panel, activate “Shrink Edges
With Distance.” Tell it to start making the edges shrink with distance
once the model is more than 3 meters away from the camera by setting the
Nominal Distance to 3m. Hit F9 for a test render. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig013.gif">Figure
13</a></font></b> – the ink lines will look thinner and thus “lighter”
for the figure at this distance.
<p>Experiment with the lighting in this scene to see what looks best with
Super Cel Shader – a spotlight might give you even more rounded shadows,
for example.
<p>As for the other Super Cel Shader buttons…
<p>When activated, ”Use Light Colors” means that the lights in the scene
can cast their colors upon the celshaded surface just as they can with
a noncelshaded surface. (The Zones still control and simplify the shading).
This could help create the illusion of someone spraying a single color
of paint on top of each shaded cel with an airbrush. For example, an orange
point light with falloff, parented to the tip of a candle, would cast orange
color onto nearby characters. A green point light, hidden inside a glowing
globe, could recreate the evil entity from Heavy Metal, casting green color
onto all characters nearby.
<p>When activated, “Bumped Edges” puts a gradient “ink line” on the celshaded
surface. “Limit” controls the falloff; “Strength” controls the opacity.
It’s angle-based, which makes it difficult to use on an unevenly angled
surface (such as a hand). However, as a surface property, it will show
up in reflections (unlike Edges). On extremely rounded characters, it might
look fine. On complex characters (such as our elf), it will probably not
behave like a hand-drawn ink line during animation. A tiny amount of angle-based
inking might be used to supplement Edges (by giving an illusion of thick-to-thin,
tapered ink lines), but for most animations it cannot replace the hand-drawn
behavior of Silhouette Edges. Test it to see if you like it.
