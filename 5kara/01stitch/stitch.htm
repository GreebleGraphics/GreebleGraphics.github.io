<h3>
Stitching the Head and Body Together</h3>
<b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head13.lwo</b> and <b>torso27.lwo</b> into Modeler
(if you just want to practice stitching geometry together, you may load
both objects from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: From the drop-down list to the left of the layer buttons,
make <b>head13.lwo</b> the current object. Go to the layer containing the
head geometry, and make that the only active layer. With nothing selected,
type c to Copy everything in that layer. Then make <b>torso27.lwo</b> the
current object. Go to the layer containing the body geometry, and make
that the only active layer. Type v to Paste a copy of the head geometry
into the body layer. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure

<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p>Because you used the points of the neck to build the spline at the bottom
of the head, these meshes should line up with each other, and their points
should overlap. A selective Merge Points operation should take care of
this. (if not, you can always fall back on Weld).
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Hit the Tab key to turn off SubPatch surfaces. Zoom in
on the seam where the head meets the neck. Set the Perspective View display
type to Wireframe Shade. Because you have separate meshes in this layer
that you do not want to make seamless with their surrounding meshes (such
as the eye sockets, the mouth interior, the glove piping, and the ponytail
holder geometry), you do not want to perform a Merge Points operation on
the entire body. Select just those points around the seam (it's OK to select
more than the points of the seam, as long as you don't select any points
that you don't want Merged, such as the mouth interior), and type m to
Merge any overlapping points together.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Eight polygons surround the neck. If Merge Points says
"8 points eliminated," you can skip to the next step. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>) If not, you must Weld each pair of points together yourself.
Type the = sign to Hide all unselected points. Zoom in on each pair and
Weld them together into single points.

<br><b>Figure 2</b>
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Deselect everything. Hit the Tab key to reactivate SubPatch
Surfaces. The neck and head should now be one seamless mesh. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>)

<p><b>STEP 6</b>: As a refinement, Zoom in on the triangles on the underside
of the neck. Select each adjacent pair of triangles one at a time and type
Shift-z to Merge them into single quad polygons. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>)
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Save this object as <b>kara01.lwo</b>.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: If you want the head spline cage to be part of this object,
copy it from <b>head13.lwo</b> and Paste it into an empty layer in <b>kara01.lwo</b>.
Then save <b>kara01.lwo</b> again.
