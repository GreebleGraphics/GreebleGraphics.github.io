<h3>
Layer Clean-Up Revisited</h3>
<b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>kara01.lwo</b> into Modeler (if you just want practice
cleaning up an object file, you may load <b>kara01.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: If the geometry in the first layer is not the elf-girl's
head and body (the CD-ROM version has a spline cage in the first layer),
Cut and Paste the geometry in the first layer to the rightmost empty layer
available. With the first layer empty,&nbsp; Cut and Paste the geometry
of the elf-girl's head and body into the first layer.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: If the geometry in the second layer is not the elf-girl's
tunic, Cut and Paste the geometry in the second layer to the rightmost
empty layer available. With the second layer empty, Cut and Paste the geometry
of the elf-girl's tunic to the second layer.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: In this way, move (Cut and Paste) all animation geometry
to the left, and all modeling geometry (spline cages, spare hands) to the
right. The CD-ROM version of <b>kara01.lwo</b>, for example, has a torso
spline cage in the fifth layer. Cut and Paste this spline cage to the rightmost
empty layer.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Type Shift-y to bring up the Layers panel. Right now
every layer is named "(unnamed)." Double-clicking on a layer's name lets
you change the name of that layer. Left-clicking on the dot underneath
the eye icon will tell LightWave whether or not to load that part of the
object into Layout. Leaving that dot in place will tell LightWave Layout
to load that layer in as an object; removing the dot will tell LightWave
to ignore it.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Rename the first layer to "Body" and the second layer
to "Tunic." Left-click on the space to the right of their layer number
to activate their "visibility" status (if a dot exists there, good. If
not, left-click on it to add the dot). For all other layers, change their
names to descriptions of what they are, and make them invisible by removing
their marks from the "eye" column. If you are using the version from the
CD-ROM, for example, it could look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=72 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p>Or, if you're up to it, you can create new layers by left-clicking on
the greyed-out listings under layer 10 in the Layers panel. If you moved
all the modeling geometry to layers 11 and up, you will free up layers
3-10 for geometry intended for animation, such as eyes and Skelegons. Because
layers 1-10 are more easily accessed than layers 11-infinity (you do not
need the Layers panel open to access layers 1-10), this might save you
an extra second or two if you find yourself needing to make a last-minute
edit on the animation geometry while animating. Creating an extra Endomorph
target, for example.
<p><a href="Fig002.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig002.GIF" ALT="Figure 2" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 2</b>
<p>An example would be <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b> -- here all modeling geometry has been moved to layers
11-14. Because their marks have been removed from the "eye" column,&nbsp;
these layers will never load into Layout as unwanted objects. However,
if you ever want to whip up another tunic for this elf-girl on the spot,
you won't have to hunt for the tunic spline cage among the myriad versions
of the torso model. The tunic spline cage will instead come with the character
-- a minor touch, but a potentially convenient one.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Save this object as <b>kara02.lwo</b>.
