<h3>
The Head – Detailing Stage 5 (Mouth)</h3>
Before we forget, let’s do the same thing for the mouth that we did for
the eye socket: block the audience’s view of the interior.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head12.lwo</b> into Modeler (you may also load
it from the CD-ROM, if you wish).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Hit the Tab key to turn off SubPatch surfaces. In the
Right View, select the polygons of the mouth region. Type = to Hide everything
else.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: In the Back View, select all of the points that rim the
inside edge of the lips in a clockwise fashion. They already belong to
a point group called “Kara Mouth (Inside Edge),” so we can just hit p at
this point to create a polgyon. Assign the surface name of “Kara Mouth
(Interior)” to this polygon. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>) Then Flip its normal inwards, to face the interior of
the mouth.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Deselect everything. Create a square polygon with the
same surface (“Kara Mouth (Interior)”) where the back of the elf-girl’s
mouth should be. If necessary, Flip its normal inwards to face the polygon
you created in the last step. Reselect the polygon you created in the last
step. With the normals of these two polygons facing inwards, use <b>Multiply
> Extend > More > Create Skin</b> to skin the two polygons together. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>)
<p>Because the points of the square did not belong to the “Kara Mouth (Inside
Edge)” group, selecting all points that belong to that group will still
only select the inside edge of the lips.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Deselect the square polygon, and cut out the remaining
selected polygon to “unblock” the mouth.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Knife through the middle of the polygons generated from
the Create Skin operation. Select the points created by the Knife tool
and Stretch them in the Right View. You now have room in this mouth for
teeth, if you want. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>)

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you do create teeth for this character, consider
making them a separate object, so that you can set the Edge Z Scale of
its ink lines set to 1.0. That way, you have no risk of the ink lines of
the teeth appearing on top of the mouth or the rest of the face, in the
event of a high Zoom lens. Also, keep the teeth as simple as possible in
order for it to look as much like a cartoon as possible. Make them a thin,
tall, half-donut shape, for example. Do not model individual teeth unless
you want to see ink lines defining each individual tooth.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Deselect everything. Select all “Kara Mouth (Interior)”
polygons; Cut and Paste them back into the layer to separate them from
the rest of the mesh. Reselect them and give them the part name of “Separate
Mesh.” Deselect everything, Unhide everything (“\”) and hit the Tab key
to convert everything into SubPatch surfaces. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b>.

<br><b>Figure 4</b>
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Save this object as <b>head13.lwo</b>.
