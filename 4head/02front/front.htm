<h3>
The Head – Spline Cage Divisions (Front)</h3>
Now that the “obvious” splines have been laid down, we must divide this
face into three- and four-sided spline boundaries. Along the way we will
define the volume of the face with each new spline.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head01.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not
follow the steps in the previous section and just want experience in fleshing
out a spline cage, you may load <b>head01.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: The outer corner of the eye lies next to a point in the
middle of the head. Select these two points (shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>) and type Ctrl-p to make a spline.

<p><b>STEP 3</b>: The inner corner of the eye lies next to a point in the
profile of the head. Select these two points (shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>) and type Ctrl-p to make a spline.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Let’s continue the line we created in Step 2. Select

side of the head, then you would have had no guarantee that the points
generated on either side of the spline dividing the front and back of the
head would “meet at the seam.”</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 14</b>: This spline could use a more rounded shape. Add a point
to the center of each section of this new spline; Drag all non-end points

13</a></font></b>. (Make sure that the outer points do not go higher than
the point at the center of the face. You want this to look like half of
an arch, not half of a heart-shape).
<p>The eye could use a “ring” of polygons around it. First, it would mimic
the flow of muscles around a real eye, helping future morph targets look
more natural. Second, it would help us establish the structure of the brow
and upper cheekbone.
<p>We need an extra point to create this spline, though. We’ll create this
point in the next step.
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Select the spline that starts from the outer corner
of the eye and runs towards the ear. Add a point to the section of this
spline that lies closest to the eye. Select the three points shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig014.gif">Figure

a point to the middle of the outermost section. Drag this new point until
it forms an arc with its counterparts on the splines above and below it,
and until the spline it belongs to looks rounded. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig015.gif">Figure

nose looks too strange. Add three points to the section of spline between

<p>Six splines border the area above the nose, inside the cheek, and under
the eye. This six-sided boundary must be split into three- or four-sided
spline boundaries in order for the Patch operation to work. A six-sided
boundary can be split into two four-sided spline boundaries with one strategically
placed spline. Adding a single dividing spline, then, would be the simplest
solution to this problem…but where should this spline go? (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig021.gif">Figure
21</a></font></b>)
<p>A spline connecting the inside corner of the eye to the outside corner
of the nose seems like the most logical decision. Of the three possible
splines, a spline running alongside the nose seems most natural.
<p><b>STEP 22</b>: Select the point at the inside corner of the eye, and

out the curve of the jaw spline with the Drag tool, if necessary. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig025.gif">Figure

its shape without sacrificing the smoothness of simple geometry in the
rest of the cage.</blockquote>

this patch into two 2-by-2 triangle patches.</blockquote>

<p>This new spline looks noticeably straighter than its counterpart in
the lip section of the profile spline. They ought to have the same general
shape, if the patches across the upper lip are to look as smooth as possible.
(Otherwise, we will get a rounded bump in the center of the upper lip that
flattens out towards the corners of the mouth, as specified by the current
shape of the lip splines).
<p>Here we have a choice. We may Split the profile spline into two separate
lines – one two-point spline for the upper lip, and one for the rest of
the profile. Then it would match the straight line of the spline we created
in Step 33, and the patched upper lip will look flat in profile.
<p>Or, we may Merge the splines we created in Steps 31 and 33 into a single
spline. As the spline threads its way through the center point, it will
round out the section covering the upper lip, and the patched upper lip
will look rounded in profile.
<p><b>STEP 34</b>: For this tutorial, we will try the latter method. Deselect
everything, select the two splines created in Steps 31 and 33, and type
Shift-z to Merge them into a single spline. It should look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig034.gif">Figure

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: The ink lines (if any) that border the lips like
lipliner in a traditional cel animated character can be faked in LightWave
with a texture map or Surface Border Edges, if necessary. This is because
those particular ink lines remains “fixed” on the surface at all times,
from all angles. A shadow (if any) on the upper lip can be faked with either
a diffuse or bump map. Worry first about the Silhouette Edges that generate
an ink line for the profile of the lips, for those Edges depend upon the
angle of the lips to the camera. The profile of the lips, then, must look
good from every angle.</blockquote>

too much. Let’s kill two birds with one stone. Add a point to its upper
section and Drag it out and forward until it better traces the contour
of the jaw, as in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig036.gif">Figure
36</a></font></b>. (Note that the placement of the extra point in the upper
section of this spline caused the lower section to flatten out a bit).
<p><b>STEP 37</b>: We have now divided the entire front half of this spline
cage into three- and four-sided spline boundaries. Save this object as
