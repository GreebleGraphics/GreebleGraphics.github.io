<h3>
The Head – Detailing Stage 1 (Surfacing and Point Groups)</h3>
<b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head05.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not follow
the steps in the previous section and just want surfacing and point naming
experience, you may load <b>head05.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Go to the layer that contains the faces of the head.
Set the Perspective View display type to “Wireframe Shade.”
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Type q to bring up the “Change Surface” panel. Assign
a surface called “Kara Face” to everything, with Smoothing turned on and
the same color values as the face and skin surfaces of the body (such as
RGB 204 183 167).
<p><b>STEP 4</b>:&nbsp; Now for the hair. Hit the Tab key to convert everything
to SubPatches – we need a better idea of where the “hairline” should fall.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>:&nbsp; Select the polygons shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>. Give them a surface called “Kara Hair,” with Smoothing
turned on and a yellow color for now (such as RGB 179 171 098).

<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p>Not as…elegant as it could be, no? We need a nice diagonal line of SubPatches
to get a nice diagonal hairline. We could try using Spin Quads to get our
diagonal lines…but we can also try a more direct approach.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Select all polygons, then go into Points Selection Mode.
Select the four points on the tip of each “staircase” SubPatch, and type
Ctrl-l (that’s a lowercase “L”) to Split the selected geometry along these
points. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure 2</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="500" >

<td VALIGN=BOTTOM><a href="Fig002.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig002.GIF" ALT="Figure 2" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>

<br><b>Figure 3</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Select the triangle SubPatches that border the hairline
and assign the “Kara Hair” surface to them. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>.
<p>That’s about as much surfacing as can be done for now. Let’s move on
to point selection groups. This will make it easier to select the points
that we want for morph targets later on.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Go into Point Selection Mode and deselect everything.
Hit the Tab key to convert everything back into polygons. Select just those
ten points that border the eye. Then go to <b>Display > Grouping > Point
Selection Sets</b> to bring up the Point Selection Sets panel. Enter “Kara
Eye” for the Point Set name, leave “Remove Points” unchecked (we want to
mark these points as part of a group, not “unmark” them), and click on
OK. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure 4</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig004.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig004.GIF" ALT="Figure 4" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: To see how this works, deselect all points. Then
type w to bring up the Point Statistics panel. At the bottom of this panel,
you should see a greyed-out text string called “(none).” Left-click on
this to select existing point groups from a drop-down list. In this case,
select “Kara Eye.” Then left-click on the white plus sign next to “Kara
Eye.” All points marked “Kara Eye” will now be selected!</blockquote>

<p>Now for the mouth. Sometimes the points lining the inside edge of the
mouth can be hardest to grab when modeling. Let’s mark them now, to make
our job easier in the future.
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Deselect everything. Select the seven points that rim
the inside of the mouth. Use Point Selection Sets to create a point set
called “Kara Mouth (Inside Edge).” (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig005.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig005.GIF" ALT="Figure 5" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 5</b>
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Deselect everything. Select all of the points of the
lips – including the ones you had selected in the previous step. Use Point
Selection Sets to create a point set called “Kara Lips (All).”
<p>The points that rim the inside of the mouth now belong to both “Kara
Mouth (Inside Edge)” and “Kara Lips (All),” proving that a point can belong
to as many groups as you like. Think of it as the point equivalent of joining
a club. A high school student might belong to an art club and a science
club – he is not forced to pick one over the other. His name will be listed
on the rosters of both clubs. So, too, can a point belong to both “Kara
Mouth (Inside Edge)” and “Kara Lips (All)” – it is not forced to pick one
over the other. It can be listed on the rosters of both point groups.

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Points live the good life. Not only does a point
get to have as many weight values as it wants, but it also gets to subscribe
to as many point group memberships as it likes. Whee!</blockquote>
