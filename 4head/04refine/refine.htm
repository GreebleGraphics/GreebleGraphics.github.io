<h3>
The Head -- Spline Cage Refinements</h3>
Just some quick spline cage clean-up here. Our chief concerns:
<p>The splines that trace the front and rear profiles of this head must
lie "flat" on the ZY plane, with X values of 0m. Otherwise, the points
along the seam will not line up when the patches of this cage are Mirrored
across the X axis.
<p>We have to make certain that no unwanted "dips" happen along the center
seam of this model.
<p>While we're at it, we might as well Smooth some of the adjacent curves
together, so that they look as rounded as a single curve. A minor concern
for a cage that will be patched with 2-by-2 patches, but important if this
cage will be used in the future to generate higher-resolution models.
<p>Last but not least, we need to make sure that no "hidden" splines lurk
in this spline cage.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head03.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not
follow the steps in the previous section and just want experience in refining
a spline cage, you may load <b>head03.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Select all the splines that run along the center of the
head in the Back View. Type Ctrl-v to bring up Set Value, and choose a
value of 0m on the X axis. Chief concern number one has just been addressed.
Leave these central splines selected. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: We're going to Mirror the splines of the face, and we
don't need duplicates of the central splines. With the central splines
selected, type the double-quotes key to Invert your selection. Now everything
but the central splines should be selected. The neck circle is already
"mirrored," so deselect the four splines of the neck circle.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>:&nbsp; Mirror the selected splines across 0m on the X
axis, with Merge Points turned on. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Select the five pairs of splines shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b> (the pairs that define the sides of the head, the forehead,
the brow, and the bridge of the nose) and type Ctrl-s to Smooth them.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Select the four pairs of splines shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure
4</a></font></b> (the diagonal splines of the brow, the cheek splines that
meet at the tip of the nose, the pair of splines that form the chin, and
the pair of splines that form the top of the upper lip) and type Ctrl-s
to Smooth them.

<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Select the two pairs of splines shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b> (the pairs that define the underside of the nose and the
bottom of the lower lip region) and type Ctrl-s to Smooth them.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Select the two pairs of splines shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b> (the pairs that define the underside of the upper lip
and the "muzzle" of the mouth) and type Ctrl-s to Smooth them.

<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Select the pair of splines defining the top of the lower
lip, and type Ctrl-s to Smooth them.
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: One more pair of splines. Select the pair of splines
shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure 7</a></font></b>
and type Ctrl-s to Smooth them.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you had tried to Smooth all of these splines
at once, you might have accidentally Smoothed them in unwanted areas. For
example, if you had selected all of the splines defining the mouth and
Smoothed them at the same time, you would have Smoothed the corners of
the mouth as well.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>Smoothing those contours that cross the center of the spline cage will
help you get a more accurate idea of how the center seam would (should)
look in the resulting SubPatch model. Smoothing a spline also lets you
achieve flatter curves near the end of the spline than would be possible
otherwise.
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: We've gained our control points; we don't need the other
half of the face anymore. Select those splines on the left side of the
face in the Back View (the elf-girl's "right side") and type x to Cut them
out. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure
8</a></font></b>. Those "floating" points are our control points, belonging
to the splines we Smoothed in Steps 5 through 10.

<br><b>Figure 9</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 12</b>: While we're Smoothing curves, Smooth the two pairs of
curves that orbit the eye in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Activate Symmetry Mode (<b>Modes > Symmetry On/Off</b>).
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: Edit the contours of this cage as you see fit with the
Drag tool. With Symmetry Mode turned on, the splines we Smoothed in Steps
5 through 10 will stay "Smoothed" as we drag their points around. This
is because their control points on the negative side of the X axis were
formed from Mirrored points from the positive side of the X axis.
<p>Your chief concern is making sure that the splines you just Smoothed
form half-arches where they meet at the center of the head in the Back
View. If they form half-heart shapes, then you will see a "dip" in the
contour at the center seam when this spline cage is Patched and the patches
are Mirrored. See <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure
10</a></font></b> for an exaggerated example of an unwanted half-heart
shape. (The panel on the left shows the unwanted "dip" in the spline; the
panel on the right shows the correctly shaped spline).

<br><b>Figure 10</b>
<p>Also check to see that the splines form graceful curves. The more rounded
the form, the better the celshading.
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: When you have finished editing, deselect everything.
Type m to Merge Points (just in case), then type Shift-i to Unify any "hidden
splines" (just in case).
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Save this object as <b>head04.lwo</b>.
