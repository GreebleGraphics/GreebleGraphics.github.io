<h3>
The Head -- Bangs</h3>
In real life, a hairline has an indistinct border -- a fade-in from a thinly
covered area of hair to a thick mass of hair. Some character designers
represent this detail by leaving the character without a clearly defined
horizontal ink line at the hairline -- instead using vertical lines (representing
the direction of the hair). Without a clear ink line bordering the hair
and face paints, one gets the overall impression of a soft, natural hairline.
<p>We can recreate this effect by deliberately burying the ends of the
hair tufts into the border between the hair and the face. Not only will
the ink lines defining the ends of the tufts get buried, but the hair tufts
will block the Surface Border edge of the hairline from view.
<p>When modeling this part of the hair, focus on the overall shape of the
hairstyle, rather than the actual number of tufts in the model sheet.In
the Back View, this elf-girl has bangs in the rough form of a crown (or
the visor of Athena's helmet; take your pick). Make the individual tufts
as thick or as thin as you like, but try to keep the mass of the bangs
in the shape of a crown.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head11.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you just want
to practice modeling bangs, you may load <b>head11.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: If we are going to obscure the hairline with hair tufts,
we could use a guideline for where the hair tufts should lie. Select all
of the points that border the hairline from ear to ear, Copy and Paste
them to an empty layer. In the Back View, select them from left to right
and type Ctrl-p to make a spline out of them. We now have a guideline that
traces the hairline of the head. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Go to a new empty layer, with this spline in the background.
Create a Cone aligned with the Y axis, with three sides and four segments.
Use these Numeric settings:
<pre><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Axis: Y
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sides: 3
Segments: 4
&nbsp; Bottom: 1.516m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Top: 1.6713m
Center X: 0m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y: 1.5937m
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z: -125.0497mm
Radius X: 18.5mm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y: 77.5mm
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z: 18.5mm</font></pre>
<b>STEP 4</b>: In the Right View, Rotate this cone 180 degrees so it points
downwards. In the Top View, rotate it until its cross-section points towards
the negative side of the Z axis. In the Back View, Move it until its widest
end touches the top of the central tuft of hair in the model sheet. In
the Right View, Move it until its narrowest end touches the tip of the
central tuft of hair in the model sheet. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Knife this geometry slightly above the tip, to keep the
tip pointed when converted to SubPatch surfaces. Then hit the Tab key to
convert everything into SubPatch surfaces.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Select the three uppermost sections of this SubPatch
cage above the tip, and Smooth Scale them outwards until they have the
thickness of the hair tufts in the model sheet. (By not Smooth Scaling
the tip, you maintain the sharp point of the tip). A Smooth Scale of about
5mm should do it. It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Type [ to activate the Shear tool (<b>Modify > Move >
More > Shear</b>). In the Back View, right-click on the top of this geometry
and drag out the falloff triangle to the bottom of this geometry. Tap the
"up" arrow key on your keyboard until the right curve of the triangle best
matches the curve of the central hair tuft in the model sheet. Then left-click
and drag to the right to curve the geometry into the shape shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Leave the Shear tool active. Tap the "right" arrow key
on your keyboard until the leftmost curve of the falloff triangle in the
Right View best matches the curve of the hair tufts in the Right View.
Then, in the Right View, left-click and drag on the geometry until it bows
outwards into the shape shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Select the topmost SubPatch surface. Activate the Smooth
Shift tool and right-click on the selected geometry. In the Right View,
rotate this SubPatch surface to the right until its points form the top
of an arch, as shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Smooth Shift the selected polygon again, and use both
the Rotate and Move tools to get it to touch the spline guide in the background.
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: Cut the selected SubPatch surface out of the geometry.
The base of the hair tuft should intersect the spline guide in the background
(if not, move the points of the hair base until it does). Assign the existing
surface name of "Kara Hair" to the entire geometry. It should look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure
7</a></font></b>.
<p>The end of this hair tuft qualifies as an Unshared Edge. As long as
the Unshared Edges box is left unchecked in Layout, we won't have to worry
about horizontal ink lines showing up on the face of the elf girl in the
event of an Edge Z Scale problem.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Don't fret about the loss of an ink line on all
of the "Separate Mesh" polygons (eye socket, eyebrow, glove trim, etc)
-- they actually qualify as Surface Border Edges in Layout. For SubPatch
geometry, overlapping points get merged after subdivision in Layout.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: For future convenience, select the three SubPatch surfaces
at the base of this hair tuft and assign the part name of "Kara Bangs (Base)"
to them.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: If you wish, select the geometry above the tip and Smooth
Scale them outwards slightly to "puff out" the thickness of the hair tuft.
(If you choose to puff out the hair tip as well, you will lose the sharp
point of the hair tip). It will look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 14</b>: The model sheet shows pairs of hair tufts. Select all
geometry. Copy and Paste it into the same layer; move and rotate the selected
original to the side. Make sure that it, too, intersects the spline guide
for the hairline in the background layer. Use the Size tool to shrink it
slightly. Then deselect the tip of the geometry, and use a negative Smooth
Scale (about --5mm or --6mm) to thin the shape of the hair tuft. It should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure 9</a></font></b>.
(Remember that the more the two tufts intersect, the less of an ink line
that you will see between them. With that in mind, pick the style you like
best).
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Select all geometry. Copy and Paste it into the same
layer, then Move, Rotate, and Size the original until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig010.gif">Figure
10</a></font></b>. Make sure that the base of the selected geometry intersects
the spline guide in the background -- you want it to intersect the hairline
of the head in the future.

<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Repeat the last step until you have hair tufts covering
the entire side of the head. . When finished, it should look something
like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig011.gif">Figure 11</a></font></b>.
Make sure that the base of every tuft intersects the spline guide in the
background, as though you were threading them on a string. For now, worry
about how the base of each hair tuft looks -- you will tweak the tips in
the next step.

<p><b>STEP 17</b>: Select the outermost pair of hair tufts (Tip: select
their tips in the Back View, then type ] to Select Connected geometry).
Deselect their base polygons, so that they will keep intersecting with
the spline guide no matter what we do to the rest of the geometry. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig012.gif">Figure
12</a></font></b>) (Tip: if you can't reach the base polygons easily, use
the Polygon Statistics panel to deselect all geometry that falls under
the part name of "Kara Bangs (Base)"). Use the Rotate,&nbsp; Move and Stretch
tools to both lengthen and spread these hair tufts away from the face,
so that they look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig013.gif">Figure
13</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 18</b>: Repeat the step for the other hair tufts, until they
look like
<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig014.gif">Figure 14</a></font></b>.
Make sure that the non-base sections of the hair tufts form a nice arc
in the Top View.

<p><b>STEP 19</b>: Let's extend some of that arc to the front view. In
the Top View, select all of the base sections of the hair tufts; type =
to Hide all unselected geometry. Then, in the Top View, select all of the
points that lie on the borders between the base geometry and the (hidden)
tuft geometry -- the points at the apex of each hair tuft. With those points
still selected, type the backslash key ("\") to Unhide all hidden geometry.
<p><b>STEP 20</b>: Activate the Shear tool, and (in the Top and Right View),
draw the falloff shape from end to end of those selected points that you
want to raise into a more arc shape. Tap the right arrow key on your keyboard
to choose the shape whose upper edge best matches the arc of the hair in
the Back View. Then, in the Back View, left-click and drag up to push the
points into more of an arc. (You might want to have the display type of
the Back View set to Smooth Shade for a better idea of the shape of the
hair in the Back View). (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig015.gif">Figure

more hair tufts, as seen in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig016.gif">Figure

you. You may want to make the head geometry an additional foreground layer,
so that you can make sure the base of these new hair tufts intersect the
head at the hairline.
