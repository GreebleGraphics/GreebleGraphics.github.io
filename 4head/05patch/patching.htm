<h3>
The Head – Patching</h3>
For spline patching tips and tricks, follow the spline exercises from the
CD-ROM.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head04.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not
follow the steps in the previous section and just want spline patching
experience, you may load <b>head04.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p>With one exception, everything here should be Patched with settings
of 2-by-2 with Knots turned on for both Perpendicular and Parallel. We’ll
Patch the three-sided boundaries (including that one exception) first.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Select the three splines that define the underside of
the chin in the order shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>. Type Ctrl-f to activate the Patch tool. Patch this area
with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots turned on for both Perpendicular and
Parallel. The triangles should point towards the neck, away from the chin
spline (which was selected last).

<blockquote><b>Tip</b>: With triangle patches, the order in which we select
the splines will control the direction of the triangles. The triangles
will point away from the last spline selected. Another way to look at it:
the first two splines selected in a triangular spline boundary form an
“arrow” indicating the direction that the triangles will point when patched.</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Select the three splines that define the upper lip area
in the order shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>; type Ctrl-f to activate the Patch tool. Patch this area
with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots turned on for both Perpendicular and
Parallel. The triangles should point into the corner of the lip, away from
the mouth profile spline (which was selected last).

<p><b>STEP 4</b>:&nbsp; Select the three splines shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b> that define the underside of the nose. Patch this area
with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots turned on for both Perpendicular and
Parallel. (If you selected them in the correct order, the patch will look
like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>.
If not, hit u to Undo the Patch operation, reselect the splines in a different
order, and try the Patch operation again).
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Select the three splines that define the lower lip area,
in such a way that the triangles will go into the corner of the lip. Type
Ctrl-f to activate the Patch tool. Patch this area with settings of 4 for
Perpendicular and 2 for Parallel, with Knots turned on for both Perpendicular
and Parallel. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure 4</a></font></b>)

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you chose to add an extra spline that divides
this region into two triangle patches, you may skip Step 5 and just patch
those triangle patches with settings of 2-by-2. Just remember to select
the spline opposite of the mouth corner last for each patch, so that the
triangles will be in the right place.</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Patch everything else with settings of 2-by-2 with Knots
turned on for both Perpendicular and Parallel.
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Deselect everything. Type w to activate Polygon Statistics.
Use this panel to select all the Faces in this layer. Cut and Paste these
Faces to an empty layer. Type m to Merge all overlapping points. It should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure 5</a></font></b>.

<p><b>STEP 8</b>: Save this object as <b>head05.lwo</b>.
