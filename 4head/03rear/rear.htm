<h3>
The Head -- Spline Cage Divisions (Rear)</h3>
Just as with the front of the head, we should describe the back of the
head with as few splines as possible. Fewer patches translate into fewer
points and fewer SubPatches, which in turn means a smoother, rounder form.
The rounder the form, the better the shading. The better the shading, the
better the celshading.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>head02.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not
follow the steps in the previous section and just want experience in fleshing
out a spline cage, you may load <b>head02.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Select the three points shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b><font color="#000000"> </font>and type Ctrl-p to create
a spline.

<p><b>STEP 3</b>: This spline could look more rounded. Add a point to each
of its two sections and Drag them until it resembles <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>.
<p>Well, we could Patch this cage now, but the line of the spline we just
created does not continue through the neck. We could add a spline through
the neck boundary...but we have another option.
<p>Three splines currently compose the rearmost neck boundary. Four sides
are just as acceptable, so...
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: At its center point, Split the top spline of the rearmost
neck boundary into two splines. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>)

<p>If you used the same Patch settings on every spline boundary, the patches
in this area would now line up with each other. Still, it would be nice
if these splines traced the same path as the original single spline.
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Type Ctrl-s to smooth the two splines created in the
last step. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig004.gif">Figure 4</a></font></b>)
<p>We're not done yet. While we could still Patch this cage, the plan is
to Patch it with settings of 2-by-2 all over (save for the triangle patch
that defines the lower lip), so as to keep the face geometry as smooth
and as simple as possible. While this is good for the face, the top of
the back of the head might not have enough geometry in it to stick to the
lines of the model sheet. It might end up <i>too</i> rounded, with the
loosely anchored SubPatches pulling into the head.
<p>We could just remember to patch this area and the triangle area bordering
it with 4-by-2 patches...but that would result in two more polygons than
we need in that triangle area. Let's explore an alternate route.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Select the spline defining the rear profile of the head.
Add a point to the center of its upper section. Drag the other points out
until they are spaced evenly apart, and the spline traces the ink line
defining the rear of the head in the model sheet. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig005.gif">Figure
5</a></font></b>)

</tr>
</table>

<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Select the points shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig006.gif">Figure
6</a></font></b> and create a spline.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: A head shouldn't flatten out back there. Add a point
to the center of the spline you created in the last step, and Drag it out
until the spline better represents the rounded contour of a head. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig007.gif">Figure
7</a></font></b>)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Let's make sure the patches on this cage line up easily. We'll use the
same trick that we used on the rear of the neck -- by turning a three-sided
spline boundary into a four-sided spline boundary.
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: Select the spline of the triangle spline boundary that
runs through the outermost point of the spline you created in Step 7. Split
this spline into two at the point where it touches the Step 7 spline. It
should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig008.gif">Figure 8</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Use Ctrl-s to Smooth these two adjacent splines back
into the smooth curves of the original whole spline. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig009.gif">Figure
9</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig009.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig009.GIF" ALT="Figure 9" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 9</b>
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: Save this object as <b>head03.lwo</b>.
