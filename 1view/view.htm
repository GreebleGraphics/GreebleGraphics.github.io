<h3>
Setting Up Modeler's Backdrops</h3>
<b>STEP 1</b>: Open Modeler.
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Each viewport has its own titlebar. The leftmost titlebar
button controls a viewport's point-of-view (such as Top, Back, and Right).
Make sure that the lower-left viewport is set to Back (XY) and that the
lower-right viewport is set to Right (ZY)
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: To change the point-of-view of a viewport, left-click
on the leftmost button in that viewport's toolbar and drag the cursor up
or down the selections on that button's drop-down list.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Type d to activate the Display Options panel <b>(Display
> Viewports > View Options)</b>.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: In the Display Options panel, left-click on the Units
tab. Set the Grid Snap to "None" (otherwise, it'll annoy you when you attempt
to fine-tune the curves of a spline or subdivision surfaces cage). Also
set the Unit System to "SI."
<p><b>STEP 5</b>: While still in the Display Options panel, left-click
on the Backdrop tab.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: You'll see a row of four numbered buttons next to the
word "Viewport." The lower-left viewport is the "third" viewport, so left-click
on the button labeled "3."
<p><b>STEP 7</b>: Next to the word "Image" is a drop-down list button.
Left-click on this button and drag the cursor down until it reaches the
phrase "(load image)." Let go of the mouse button and the Load Backdrop
Image panel will appear. Load <b>kara_xy.iff</b> from the CD-ROM.
<p><b>STEP 8</b>: For Image Resolution, select the button labeled 1024
(so that the image will have more resolution to work with and look less
blocky).
<p>
<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: This setting looks so much like the Display settings
for OpenGL textues in Layout that it's a good chance that Modeler now uses
OpenGL to display its Backdrops.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 9</b>: I'd like to make this elf 5'6" in height, so it'll help
to have the model sheet 5'6" in height as well. Make sure that the Fixed
Aspect Ratio box in the lower-left hand corner is checked. When Fixed Aspect
Ratio is checked, the second input field for Size (the Width) will be greyed
out.
<p>The first input field for Size is the Height, and it has a default setting
of 1 meter. Type in 5'6" (I'm serious - type 5, then the single-quote key,
then 6, then the double-quote key. LightWave understands these measurement
symbols for feet and inches). Before you press the Tab key, the value should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure 1</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=75 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p>Press the Tab key (the Enter key would also enter the setting, but it
would then close the window). Since the Unit System has been set to SI,
LightWave will convert the English measurements to their equivalent in
meters - 1.6764 meters, as shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Having grown up in a country that still uses English
measurements, I find it easier to visualize a person's height in feet and
inches. However, when modeling in 3D, I prefer to have the Units set to
the math-friendly metric system. Besides, as Step 9 demonstrates, we can
still input measurements in any system we like.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 10</b>: Check the box for Pixel Blending - this will smooth
out the appearance of the pixels.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you have a slower computer, you may notice
a pause when changing settings like Image Resolution and Pixel Blending.
Modeler processes the image every time you change those settings.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 11</b>: While still in the Backdrop section of Display Options,
click on the button next to Viewport that is labeled "4."
<p><b>STEP 12</b>: For Image, load <b>kara_zy.iff</b>.
<p><b>STEP 13</b>: Turn on Pixel Blending and set the Image Resolution
to 1024. Make sure the Fixed Aspect Ratio box is checked, and set the Size
to 5'6" (it, too, will be converted to 1.6764m if the Units have been set
to a metric system). It should look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>.
<p><a href="Fig002.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig002.GIF" ALT="Figure 2" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=153 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 2</b>
<p><b>STEP 14</b>: So far, so good...but these backdrop images are centered
on the XZ plane instead of "standing" on it. Easily fixed. While still
in Viewport 4's settings, left-click on the input field immediately to
the right of Center. Replace its default setting of 0m with this mathematical
formula:
<p>5'6"/2
<p>Hit the Tab key. The mathmatical formula will have been replaced with
838.2mm which (just as the mathematical formula described) is half of the
figure's "height" (the number you had entered into the Size field). The
setting for Viewport 4 should now look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>. It might take a few seconds for Modeler to update the
viewport, but when it does you will see the side view of the figure standing
on the ground.
<p><a href="Fig003.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig003.GIF" ALT="Figure 3" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=153 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: In the past, one might have hesitated to model
the character standing on the XZ plane, when the center of gravity (and
thus, the pivot point of the character model) naturally falls somewhere
about the hips. To rotate the model itself in Layout (instead of relying
solely on bones or the model's parent objects), one would have had to set
the pivot point in Layout. Starting with LightWave 6, however, we can convieniently
set the pivot point of the object in Modeler by using the Pivot Tool (found
in the Tools section).
<p>In the past, one might also have hesitated to align the spine of the
model with the Y axis instead of the Z axis. After setting up bones, the
bone at the base of the model's spine would have been rotated 90 degrees
on its Pitch...and would have suffered from "gimbal lock" (where Bank starts
to act like Heading, causing a loss of one rotation channel). Though one
could have skirted the issue by making that gimbal-locked bone ultra-tiny
with 0% Strength (so that it would have no effect on the model), relying
instead on bones parented to it to deform the model, it still might have
been considered "wasting" a bone. However, LightWave's bones now behave
much faster than before, and weight maps let you use far fewer of them
to get the results that you want, so modern animators do not have to feel
too guilty about "spending" one or two bones on anti-gimbal-lock measures.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 15</b>: Now, we can use the same formula for Viewport 3, but
let's try something different. While still in Viewport 4's settings, move
your mouse pointer to the right of the 838.2mm value in the Center input
field. Left-click on this and drag it to the left to select the entire
value. Type Ctrl-c to copy this value. Now left-click on the button labeled
"3" next to Viewport to enter the settings for Viewport 3. Select the value
("0m") that already exists in the input field immediately to the right
of Center. Type Ctrl-v. The value 838.2mm will be pasted into the input
field, replacing the value that had been selected. Press the Tab key to
enter the value. The settings for Viewport 3 should now look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure
3</a></font></b>.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Copying and pasting values can be a useful trick
when you want to be precise, but you don't want to memorize and retype
an existing value.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Go to the Presets drop-down menu and select Save All
Backdrops. Save these settings as <b>kara.cfg</b>. Now, every time you
start Modeler to work on this project, all you have to do is type d to
enter the Display Options, left-click on the Backdrop tab, select Load
Backdrop from the Presets menu, and choose <b>kara.cfg</b> to restore your
Backdrops to the settings you entered in Steps 1-15.
