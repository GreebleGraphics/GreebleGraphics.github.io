<h3>
The Tunic -- Fitting</h3>
Say...how does this tunic look on the elf-girl's body? Does it fit perfectly...or
does it need to be "let out" in some spots?
<p>Make the tunic layer and the body layers active at the same time, and
set the Perspective View display type to "Smooth Shade." If you see any
area of the body poking through the tunic, you will need to modify that
area of the tunic to better "fit" the body. At the same time, try to keep
the mesh of the tunic as smooth and dimple-free as possible, for the best
possible celshading.
<p>If the oval-shaped belt is intersecting with the body, consider using
Stretch to maintain the rounded proportions of the belt.
<p>If the red cloth of the tunic intersects with the body, consider using
Smooth Scale to softly "puff" the offending points outwards, away from
the body.
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: If you would like some practice on "fitting" an article
of clothing to the body, load <b>torso26.lwo</b> from the CD-ROM. It contains
an embarrassingly obvious flaw... (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig001.gif">Figure
1</a></font></b>)
<p><a href="Fig001.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig001.GIF" ALT="Figure 1" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=151 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 1</b>
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: Set the Perspective View display type to "Wireframe Shade."
Look at the contours of the tunic. Each of the contours just to the outside
of the breasts seems to have a "dip" in it. This may not be the only cause
of the problem, but it should be smoothed out.
<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Make the tunic the only active layer. Make the body layer
a background layer. You can still see the problem here -- the black lines
of the background layer are still poking through the tunic.
<p><b>STEP 4</b>: Turn on Symmetry Mode (<b>Modes > Symmetry On/Off</b>).
Go into Points Selection Mode. Select the points shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig002.gif">Figure
2</a></font></b>. Right now these points lie too far back -- they're tugging
the tunic right through the figure.

</table>

<p><b>STEP 5</b>: Drag and Move these points forwards, until the black
lines of the breasts in the background layer disappear beneath the tunic.
While you're at it, round out the contour that runs through the points
by moving the center point forwards. When you have finished, it should
look like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig003.gif">Figure 3</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 6</b>: Save this object as <b>torso27.lwo</b>.
