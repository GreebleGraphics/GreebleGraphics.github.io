The Tunic – Spline Cage (Pt. 2)</h3>
<b>STEP 14</b>: Deselect everything. Select the two splines that define
the contours of the waist. Type c to Copy them, the minus key (“-“) to
Hide them, and the v key to Paste a copy of them. Select the copied splines
and Move them down until they touch the bottom of the waist (holding down
the Ctrl key to restrict the movement to one axis). Tap the backslash key
("\") to Unhide the original splines. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig014.gif">Figure

splines – one at the front, one at the back, and one at the left-hand side.

<p><b>STEP 16</b>: Make another copy of the two waist splines, this time
placing the copy at the bottom of the skirt. Use the Drag tool to make
these splines conform to the ink line defining the the bottom of the skirt
in the model sheet. Make it look as rounded as possible in the Top View.

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: Remember that Knots pays close attention to the
spacing between the points in each spline. If each spline has wildly different
point spacing, you will get a “skewed” look to the mesh as Knots twists
and turns polygons to fit the splines’ demands. Try to keep the points
of each spline on the same “level” as their counterparts in the other two
splines.
<p>For example, if a point in one spline is spaced one-third from the top
end of the spline, make sure its counterparts in the other two splines
are also spaced one-third from the top end of their splines. For Step 18,
consider the point spacing shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig018.gif">Figure

fix that. Deselect everything; select the upper “rib spline.” In the Right

tool to make sure they lie outside of the elf-girl’s body. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig022.gif">Figure

<p><b>STEP 24</b>: Check to make sure that the points of the skirt do not

<p>We can use Motion Designer in Layout to make the tunic move like real
cloth. The more points in the tunic mesh, the more accurate the cloth simulation.
Yet we don’t want too many polygons in this model. The more points Motion
Designer has to “think” about, the longer its calculations will take. The
fewer the SubPatch surfaces, the smoother and more rounded the model will
look (resulting in more attractive celshading).
<p>People will expect to see folds in the skirt (and perhaps the sleeves,
if one wanted to get fancy). So…let’s figure out how many polygons we need
in the skirt.
<p><a href="Fig024.gif"><img SRC="small/s_Fig024.GIF" ALT="Figure 24" NOSAVE BORDER=1 height=200 width=200></a>
<br><b>Figure 24</b>
<p>You need enough polygons to make a “wave motion” possible. For this
to happen, we need enough polygons to not only form a “C”-shaped curve,
but to also bend into curves shaped like “Z” and “S.” These shapes can
be seen in most “hair-blowing-in-the-wind” animations, such as the ones
in the opening animations of the <i>Escaflowne</i> and <i>Record of Lodoss
War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight</i> television series. A wave also
looks good in other secondary animations, such as “cloth-blowing-in-the-wind”
animation cycles.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: You can find more information about the “wave
principle” and secondary animation in Preston Blair’s wonderful <i>Cartoon
Animation</i> book.</blockquote>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<p>The minimum number of SubPatches you need for “wave” shapes is three,
so you only need three “rows” of polygons to form the skirt. (<b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig024.gif">Figure
24</a></font></b>) By using the minimum number, you keep the mesh looking
as soft and smooth as possible vertically.
<p>Yet how many polygons should circle the circumference of this skirt?
How many polygons do we need at the hem?
<p>The more “columns” of polygons you have across the skirt (“horizontally”),
the greater the chance of getting a fold with Motion Designer. Yet the
more polygons you have, the greater the risk of a loss of smoothness to
the mesh (which would cause a loss of smoothness to the celshading).
<p>We’ll play it safe this time, merely doubling the columns of polygons
in the skirt. To do this, we’ll divide each skirt spline boundary into
two with a spline. To make sure that the patches of the skirt still “line
up” with the patches of the belt, we’ll take advantage of triangle patches,
as seen in the next step.
<p><b>STEP 25</b>: Create two splines joined at the outermost point of
the lowest waist spline, as shown in <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig025.gif">Figure
25</a></font></b>. As you will see in the patching stage, using the triangle
splines lets you get away with more polygons in the skirt, without that
complexity trickling up into the waist section and above (where it is not
needed).

<p><b>STEP 26</b>: Add two points to each spline, at the same level as
those of their counterparts. Use the Drag tool to help each spline blend
in with the contours of its neighbors, until it looks like <b><font color="#CC0000"><a href="Fig026.gif">Figure
26</a></font></b>.
<p><b>STEP 27</b>: Clean-up time. Deselect everything. Select all center
splines in the Back View, type Ctrl-v and use Set Value to make sure they
lie at 0m on the X axis. Deselect everything. Type m to Merge Points, then
type Shift-i to Unify Polygons. These last two steps will make sure that
no pesky “hidden splines” will mess with you during the patching stage.
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote><b>Note</b>: “Hidden splines” (and other instances of “hidden”
geometry) occur when you hit the Paste key two or more times by accident
– pasting two or more copies of the same geometry into the same space by
mistake. It happens more often than you might think – usually when one
is caught in a rush to get things done. Remember – the way out of hidden
geometry (when the “Undo” operation is not available) is to Merge Points
(m) and then Unify Polygons (Shift-i). This works for hidden splines, hidden
SubPatches, and hidden polygons.</blockquote>
