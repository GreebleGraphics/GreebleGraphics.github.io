<h3>
Layer Clean-Up</h3>
If you are using the torso objects from the CD-ROM, or if you have not
emptied layers during the previous tutorial sections, then you will notice
that the first ten layers of this object are “full.” You can access layers
11-infinity through the Layers floating panel (<b>Modeler > Windows > Layer
Browser Open/Close</b>), but several of the layers contain geometry that
we don’t need anymore. Let’s do a little “clean-up.”
<p><b>STEP 1</b>: Load <b>torso23.lwo</b> into Modeler. (If you did not
do the previous tutorial sections and just want to practice cleaning unneccessary
layers out of an object file, you may load <b>torso23.lwo</b> from the
CD-ROM).
<p><b>STEP 2</b>: If the first ten layers of your object are full, go into
each of the layers that contain unneeded geometry and type x to Cut that
geometry out of that layer (thus emptying that layer).

<blockquote><b>Note</b>: If you’re using the the CD-ROM version of this
object, layers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 contain geometry that you do not need
anymore. Keep the two layers that contain the geometry for the body and
the tunic (of course); decide for yourself whether or not you want to keep
the intact spline cages for the torso and tunic, as well as the geometry
for the hand. If you want to remodel any part of this character in the
future, it doesn’t hurt to have the primary “building blocks” included
with the character.
<p>You can use the Layers panel to tell LightWave which layers of the object
will be loaded into Layout by left-clicking on the rightmost column (the
column under the little “eye” symbol) for that layer. If the rightmost
column is checked, that layer will be loaded into Layout when you load
the object into Layout. By default, all layers have that rightmost column
checked.
<p>Don’t delete a layer just to keep it from loading into Layout. Delete
only those layers that you don’t need anymore – or layers of geometry that
can be quickly rebuilt from other layers. For example, Layers 2-5 from
the CD-ROM version of <b>torso23.lwo</b> contain partial copies of the
spline cage from Layer 1. Because they can be quickly recreated from Layer
1, you can afford to delete Layers 2-5 from the CD-ROM version of <b>torso23.lwo</b>.</blockquote>

<p><b>STEP 3</b>: Save this object as <b>torso24.lwo</b>.
