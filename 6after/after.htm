<h3>
Afterword</h3>
When modeling, <i>always</i> use the fastest tool that gets you the highest
quality results. When faced with a time-consuming mechanical task that
a computer might do quickly and precisely, spend five minutes looking at
the tools available in Modeler. You may discover a tool that does exactly
what you need…when exploited in the right way.
<p>Read available books on film, art, animation and comics from your local
library. Study your favorite cartoons and comics – the designs, the colors,
the shading. Decide what you like best about them, and put it into your
celshading artwork.
<p>Keep learning. Create the cartoon that <i>you</i> want to see. Give
it everything you’ve got!
<p>And have fun doing it.
